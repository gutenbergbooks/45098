<h2>BORIS THE BEAR-HUNTER.</h2>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />

THE HUNTER HUNTED.</h2>


<p>The moment at which I propose to introduce
my readers to Boris the Bear-Hunter came
very near, as it happened, to being the last which my
hero was destined to spend upon this earth. Great
hunter as Boris was, there is no doubt about it that
on this particular occasion he met his match, and
came within measurable distance of defeat at the
hands&mdash;or rather paws&mdash;of one of the very creatures
whose overthrow was at once his profession and his
glory.</p>

<p>It happened many a year ago&mdash;about two hundred,
in fact; and the scene of Boris's adventure was an
exceedingly remote one, far away in the north of
Europe, close to Archangel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris Ivanitch was a peasant whose home was an
outlying village near the large town just mentioned.
He was a serf, of course, as were all his fellows
at that time; but in consequence of his wonderful
strength and courage, and of his aptitude for pursuing
and killing every kind of wild beast and game, he
was exempt, by favour of his lord, both from taxation
and from the manual labour which the owner of the
soil could have exacted from him. In a word, Boris
was employed to keep the country clear, or as clear
as possible, of bears and wolves, which, when left to
themselves, were at that time the cause of much
danger and loss to the inhabitants of that portion of
the Russian empire.</p>

<p>Boris performed his duties well. There was no
man, young or old, for hundreds of miles around who
could compare with this young giant in any of those
sports or competitions in which the palm went to the
strongest. Tall and muscular beyond his years&mdash;for
he was but nineteen at this time&mdash;lithe as a willow,
straight as a poplar, Boris excelled in anything which
called into play the qualities of activity and strength.
Had he lived in our day and attended an English
public school, he would undoubtedly have come to the
front, whether on the cricket or the football field, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the running path or on the river. But being debarred
from the privileges of English schoolboys, Boris was
obliged to expend his energies in those exercises which
were open to him, and which alone were familiar to
the people of his country&mdash;snow-shoeing, hunting,
swimming, and similar sports natural to the livers of
a wild, outdoor life in a scarcely civilized land.</p>

<p>It was early summer-time, and the woods, or rather
forests, about Archangel were in their fullest heyday
of life and beauty. Hundreds of square miles of
pine trees were the principal feature of the landscape,
dotted here and there by a patch of cultivated land,
or watched over by a tumble-down village nestling
beneath the shadow of the forest. Oats and wheat,
now fast ripening, waved in the soft air of June, and
told of peace and plenty for those who took the
trouble to till the generous soil for a living. The
prospects of the crops around Dubinka, Boris's village,
appeared at first sight to be promising enough&mdash;the
rye was tall and nearly ripe, and the oats were
doing capitally; but had you asked the peasants, the
owners of the crops, they would have told you, with
the lamentations common to the Russian peasant,
that God had certainly been very good to them and
sent them a fine harvest, but that the devil had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
spoiled all the good work by sending two large bears
to eat up and trample down the fruits of the field,
and to ruin the poor peasants. Ivan's field was half
eaten up already, they would have said, and Andrey's
would go next. And Boris couldn't find the bears, or
he would soon give them "something in their stomachs
better for them than the peasants' oats;" but there
was no snow, and Boris could not track them without
it, though he had been after the brutes for a fortnight
and more.</p>

<p>This was all true enough&mdash;indeed, Boris was "after
them" at the present moment, though to look at
him you would scarcely have thought it; for the
hunter was busily engaged strolling lazily through
the forest, picking and enjoying the beautiful wild
strawberries which covered the ground in profusion.
He had propped his bear-spear against a tree, and
was at the moment some distance from the weapon&mdash;tempted
away from it against his usual habit by the
peculiar lusciousness of the fruit, which was warm
from the sun, and very delicious.</p>

<p>Even strawberry eating palls at length upon the
satiated palate, and Boris began to think that he
had had enough. He would now resume, he thought,
his search for those marauding bears who had broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
into the village corn-fields and destroyed the peace of
the poor peasants. So he picked one more handful of
the strawberries, crammed them into his mouth, sighed,
glanced regretfully at the delicious fruit at his feet,
and finally raised his head to look for his bear-spear.
As he did so, he became aware of a huge form standing
close at hand, some ten yards away, showing its teeth,
and quietly watching his movements. It was a bear!</p>

<p>Boris's first feeling was one of great joy at meeting
his enemy at last; his second was one of dismay as
he realized the want of his trusty spear.</p>

<p>It must not for a moment be supposed that Boris
was alarmed by the situation. If any one had told
him that he was in a situation of peril, he would
have laughed aloud at the very idea of such a thing.
His regret was caused solely by the fear that, being
unarmed, he might lose the opportunity of doing
business with that bear upon this particular occasion,
and would probably have to find him again before
settling accounts.</p>

<p>Hoping to catch sight of his spear, and to reach it
before the bear could make off, Boris backed slowly
towards the place where he thought he had left the
weapon. Bruin did not, as he had expected, give a
loud roar to show his enemy that he was an awful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
fellow if he liked, and then straightway turn and run.
On the contrary, the brute advanced towards the
hunter, growling and showing certain very large and
business-like teeth. Then Boris felt that it would be
well to find that spear of his as quickly as possible,
for he had no other weapon about him, and the bear
appeared to be very much in earnest. So the hunter
turned and ran, with the bear at his heels.</p>

<p>At first Boris rather enjoyed the chase. It would
be an amusing story to tell at the village when he
arrived there with the bear's skin. How the peasants
would all laugh, and how they would sing and make
merry in the evening over the downfall of their
enemy! Boris could afford to tell a good story about
himself and a bear, even though the laugh had been
on the bear's side to begin with, if he produced the
skin of the bear at the same time.</p>

<p>Yes, <i>if</i>. But the growling of the brute sounded
rather close at his ear, and Boris was forced to dodge
in and out between the tree trunks in order to avoid
capture.</p>

<p>As the moments passed, and he grew more and
more out of breath, Boris longed eagerly for the welcome
sight of his bear-spear. Once or twice the
bear had so nearly collared him that he bethought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
him that he must devise some plan by which to gain
a little breath. A roar and a rush from behind at
this moment, together with the loss of a considerable
portion of the tail of his shirt, which, being worn
outside the trousers, Russian fashion, had fluttered in
the breeze, made it plain that there was no time to
be lost. He must take to a tree and gain time. So
Boris pulled himself together, put on a mighty spurt,
and was five feet up the stem of a pine tree just as
Bruin reached the foot of it, and rose on his hind
legs to follow him aloft.</p>

<p>Up went Boris and up went Bruin, both fine
climbers, and both scrambling and puffing as though
their very lives depended upon their agility, as indeed
was the case so far as concerned one at least of
them. Quick as he was, Boris was nearly caught.
He had barely time to climb along a branch and let
himself fall to the earth, when the bear was already
upon the same bough and looking down after him,
meditating as to whether he too should drop to the
ground or adopt the slower and safer course of climbing
down again by the trunk, as he had come up.
Luckily for Boris the discretion of that bear prevailed
over his desire to save time, and he decided upon the
slower method of descent. This decision gave Boris a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
moment or two of breathing time, which he sadly required.</p>

<p>He sat down to rest, and looked around frantically
in every direction in hopes of catching sight of his
spear. That action nearly cost him his life. The
bear, impatient as bears are when irritated, could not
tolerate the slow process of descending which it had
chosen, and when half-way down the stem of the pine
had dropped the rest of the way in order to gain time.
Boris was barely able to rise and slip away when the
heavy brute dropped upon the very spot where he had
been sitting. Away went Boris, slightly refreshed,
and with his "second wind" coming on, and after
him flew Bruin, furious and determined. Again Boris
dodged and ran, and ran and dodged, and again he
felt the hot breath and heard the loud pants and
growls at his ear; again his breath began to fail him,
and his heart as well, when, just as he was nearly
spent, his eye fell upon that which was to him at that
moment the fairest sight that ever his eye beheld&mdash;his
beloved spear leaning against a tree-trunk one
hundred yards away.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />

BORIS FINDS A NEW FRIEND.</h2>


<p>Boris was so exhausted with the long chase that
he had hardly sufficient strength to reach the
weapon and turn it against his furious pursuer. To
do this he must gain ground upon the bear, which
was at the instant so close behind that he could have
kicked it with his heel. Summoning therefore all the
energy of which he was still master, the hunted hunter
filled his lungs to the full, and started to run the
fastest hundred yards that he had ever covered. So
swiftly did he fly over the ground that he was some
twenty-five good paces in front of the bear when his
hands closed upon his faithful spear, and he knew
that, for the moment at least, he was saved, and that
if only his strength did not fail him he should now
hold his own and perhaps a little more when Bruin
came to close quarters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Twisting round with the rapidity of a spindle, Boris
felt for a steady foothold for both of his feet, found
it, poised his long steel-tipped wooden spear, took a
long, deep breath, set his teeth, and in a moment the
struggle had commenced. The bear, slightly rising on
his hind legs to seize and hug his foe, threw himself
with a loud roar of rage upon Boris, impaling himself
as he did so upon the cruel point of the spear. This
was a critical moment. Strong as he was, and firmly
as he had taken his stand, the shock of the huge
brute's rush all but knocked poor weary Boris off his
legs and nearly tore his muscular arms from their
sockets. The bear, mad with pain and rage, pressed
in its fury upon the stout spear, and bit and tore at
the good oak until the splinters flew and the whole
spear shook and trembled in the hunter's grasp.</p>

<p>Breathless and weary as he was, Boris nevertheless
held his own, and for some time budged not
an inch.</p>

<p>There is a limit, however, to the powers of the
hardest muscles and of the stoutest hearts, and the
present tension was more than the bravest and the
strongest could support for any length of time.
Boris was evidently tiring. Had he been fresh when
this great wrestling match began, he would long since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
have made an irresistible rush, pushed the monster
over backwards, and despatched him with repeated
digs of the spear, as he had many a time treated bears
before. But Boris was weary with his long struggle.
He could not hold on much longer, but in desperation
he still clung to his quivering spear, and pushed with
all his might and determination against his giant
enemy.</p>

<p>And now his head began to swim, and his eyes
grew hot and dimmed, and there was a sound in his
ears as of waters that rushed in and overwhelmed
him. Still his senses did not desert him, nor his
nerve. As he became conscious that his strength was
failing him he became the more determined to hold
out, and with a hoarse shout of defiance he pulled
himself together for one supreme effort. His failing
grasp clutched tighter at the shaft; his stiff and
aching feet planted themselves yet more firmly in
their grip of the foothold from which they had not
budged by a hair's-breadth; his tightened muscles
tightened themselves yet more as he bore upon the
shaft, and forced it by sheer strength of will a couple
of inches further towards victory. The bear tottered,
his eyes rolled and his tongue showed between his
teeth, and for a moment it seemed that Boris had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
won the battle. Now it is anybody's game! For an
instant and another neither bear nor man has the
advantage. Then the bear rallies. Growling, sputtering,
roaring, the monster slowly recovers his lost
ground, then gains an inch, and another. Boris feels
faint and dizzy; his strength is failing, his grasp
relaxing. Still he fights on; but it is useless now.
His brave feet, that have held their own so long,
give way; his muscles too, they have made a good
fight, but they cannot hold out longer&mdash;they are
relaxing; his fingers are loosening their hold upon
the shaft; his eyes are so dim now that they cannot
see the monster who is falling upon him to slay him;
he is vanquished, he is giving ground rapidly; in
another instant he will fall, and die. The bear will
die too, of course; that thought will be his dying
consolation.</p>

<p>A shout of encouragement behind him, and the
sound of rushing feet! "Hold tight there just one
minute more!" somebody cries; and automatically the
stiffened fingers tighten themselves, and the feet grip
the ground. Then a fresh hand grasps the shaft; two
powerful feet plant themselves in the place where the
failing ones have stood; and as the wearied and
vanquished Boris falls fainting to the earth, the new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
arrival bears upon that stout staff with a force which
even the mighty bear cannot withstand.</p>

<p>Back goes the bear by inches&mdash;now he is tottering&mdash;another
shout and an irresistible rush forwards,
and he is down, fighting and tearing to the last as a
bold king of the forest should.</p>

<p>One more dig into the dying monster, a kick upon
the prostrate carcass with the long, heavy Russian
boot, and then the stranger turns to look after poor
Boris. But first he wipes his hands upon a tuft of
purple-fruited bilberry leaves, and from an inner
pocket of his somewhat rich-looking <i>kaftan</i>, or tunic,
he produces a silver-tipped flagon of Russian spirits.
This he puts to the lips of Boris, who soon revives
under the treatment, and sits up, dazed, to stare
around with his hand to his eyes. First he fixes a
long look upon the prostrate bear and the spear
lying beside it; then he catches sight of the stranger,
and stares long and fixedly at him. At last he says,
"Are you St. Boris come to save me in answer to
my call?"</p>

<p>The stranger burst into a loud, jovial guffaw.</p>

<p>"Bless your heart," he shouted, "I'm not a saint!
Very far from it, I'm afraid. I'm only a man, like
yourself."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>"A man indeed!" said Boris; "and such a man as
I have not seen the likeness of&mdash;well, since I last
looked in the looking-glass!"</p>

<p>Boris made this remark in perfectly good faith, and
without the slightest intention of paying himself a
compliment. He knew well enough that he was by
many degrees the strongest and finest-looking man
in the country side, and by comparing the stranger
with himself he merely offered honest testimony to
the magnificent appearance of the latter. Nor was
his admiration misplaced, for a finer-looking young
fellow than he who now bent over Boris was rarely
seen. Scarcely more than a boy&mdash;he was about the
same age as Boris himself&mdash;the stranger was tall and
robust, and straight as a young pine; taller than
Boris, and broader too, though not more athletic-looking.
His face was handsome and powerful, and
his black hair curled in masses over a wide forehead
and bold, rather cruel eyes. Boris gazed in admiration
at this magnificent specimen of humanity&mdash;it
was a new sensation to him to see any one physically
superior to himself.</p>

<p>"You made a good fight," said the stranger, guffawing
once more over the last speech of Boris; "but
though you seem to have a fairly good opinion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
yourself, that bear would have been lying on the top
of you by this time if I had not come up in the nick
of time. I watched the fight for some minutes. You
have pluck, I am pleased to observe. What is your
name?"</p>

<p>"Boris the Bear-Hunter," replied that worthy.</p>

<p>"Ha, ha! Boris the Bear-<i>Hunted</i>, you mean,"
laughed the stranger. "Well, I should like to know
more of you, if you will. Come and see me to-morrow
morning at Archangel, and we'll have a
chat."</p>

<p>"Very well, <i>barin</i>" (gentleman), said Boris, feeling,
in spite of his own usually defiant independence of
spirit, that here was one who must of necessity command
and be obeyed; "for I see you are a barin by
your kaftan. What are you called, and where shall
I seek you?"</p>

<p>"Petka, and sometimes Petrushka, is my name,"
said the big youth; "and you may ask for me at
the burgomaster's house in the town. You will hear
of me there till eleven to-morrow; after that I take
ship for a sail abroad. And now I will leave you
and <i>mishka</i><a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> yonder to take care of one another.
Beware, while you skin him, that he doesn't jump up
and skin <i>you</i>. He may be shamming while I am
here, you see; but he has no cause to be afraid of
you."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>
<p>With which gentle sarcasm and another jovial laugh
the tall youth departed, leaving Boris to reflect upon
the extreme good fortune which had sent him the
right man at the right moment to extract him from
the tightest fix he had ever succeeded in getting
himself into during the whole course of his nineteen
summers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />

BORIS CHANGES MASTERS.</h2>


<p>Boris, when he returned to the village that
same afternoon, enjoyed a veritable triumph
at the hands of his delighted fellows. He was honest
enough to confess his indebtedness to the stranger,
but this did not make the slightest difference in the
gratitude of the peasants; and indeed the service
which Boris had rendered them, in thus ridding them
of an infliction worse than the most terrible blight,
was no slight one. A large bear, when so disposed,
and when allowed to work his wicked will upon the
corn-fields of a village, will very speedily either consume
or trample into hay the entire grain wealth of
the community; so that the gratitude of the peasants
was proportionate to their clear gain in the death of
one of the two monster pests which had come, like a
scourge upon the village, to devour the fatness thereof.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris was carried shoulder-high through the one
street of the place; while the carcass of the dead
robber, slung by his four legs to a pole, was borne
behind, escorted by a booing, yelling crowd of women
and children. A bonfire was lighted at night in
honour of the hunter and his achievement, when
portions of the bear were cooked and eaten, more as
an expression of contempt for the late owner of the
flesh than for love of the food. Most of the carcass
was given to the dogs, however, and they, at least,
were delighted with the feast.</p>

<p>Boris was well feasted with <i>vodka</i> and with other
delicacies equally bad for him; but being a sensible
youth and steady withal, he did not retire at night in
the degraded condition of most of his fellow-villagers.
He was elated, no doubt, not by the fumes of the
spirits, however, but by the sense of triumph; yet
the more he pondered over his fight and victory, the
more clearly did he realize his indebtedness to the
timely aid of the strong young giant who had come
to his assistance. As he lay and dozed, half conscious,
through the hot hours of the summer night, Boris
weaved the adventure of the day into a thousand
fantastic shapes, in all of which, however, the stranger
played an important part: sometimes he was his own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
patron saint; then he was a benevolent <i>lieshui</i>, or
wood-spirit, a class of beings fully believed in by the
peasants, but, according to popular tradition, more
likely to take the part of the bear than of Boris in
a fight between the two. In a word, the stranger
assumed so many various shapes in the hunter's overwrought
brain at night, that when day came Boris
was by no means certain whether the stranger had in
reality existed at all, and was inclined to fancy that
the whole thing had been a dream as he lay and slept
after the death of the bear, which he had slain single-handed.</p>

<p>Half hoping that this might prove to be the case&mdash;for
the idea that he had almost been worsted by a
bear, however huge, was an unwelcome thought to
so renowned a hunter&mdash;Boris determined, nevertheless,
that he would at least journey as far as the
town, which was but a mile or two distant, in order
to learn for himself whether there indeed existed a
young giant of the name of Petka.</p>

<p>Boris set out at the appointed hour for Archangel
and the house of the burgomaster. The house was
easily found, for it was the principal building of the
place, and was so grand, indeed, to look upon that
Boris scarcely liked his mission. What if the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
thing should have been a dream? Why, what a fool
he would appear, coming to this grand place and
inquiring for some one who did not exist; all these
serfs and dressed-up people about the front door
would laugh at him, and tell him to go home and
drink less vodka the next time he killed a bear.
However, Boris reflected, if any one should laugh at
him, laughers were easily knocked down. He was
as good a man, and perhaps a trifle better, than any
of these embroidered chaps. Let them laugh if they
liked; their mirth might cost them a little of their
embroidery! So Boris pulled himself together, and
marched up to the porch of the big wooden structure
which had been pointed out to him as the house of
the burgomaster. A stately doorkeeper, dressed, in
spite of the warmth of the season, in a gold-laced
kaftan and a high fur cap, listened to the young
peasant's inquiry with some bewilderment. Was
there any one living there of the name of Petka?
Boris had asked,&mdash;a young fellow about his own age?
Boris believed he was a barin, but could not be sure;
he gave this address.</p>

<p>"Petka?" repeated the astonished porter. "What
do you mean? Petka who? What's his family
name?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"I only know he called himself Petka; he said
sometimes he was known as Petrushka," said Boris,
beginning to feel assured that he was the victim of
a dream. "He was a tall, well-set-up sort of a
fellow," he continued, "as big as I am, or bigger.
Come now; is he here, or is he not? I warn you I
am not a man to annoy; I am Boris the Bear-Hunter."</p>

<p>It was not meant as an idle boast. Had the doorkeeper
been a native of the town he would have
known well enough who the bearer of this name was;
but it so happened that this man was a new arrival
from Moscow, whence he had come with the retinue
of his master the Tsar, and therefore the title meant
nothing to him, but savoured only of boasting and
the conceit of local celebrity.</p>

<p>"Well," he said, "you can go home again and hunt
your bears at leisure; there's no Petka, nor yet
Petrushka, here. As for annoying you, I know
nothing about that, but you are going the right way
to get yourself a taste of the knout, my friend; and
if you don't clear out of this street in double quick
time, I shall summon those who are very well able to
make you cry, though you may be the best bear-sticker
that ever walked. Now then, off you go!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The fellow laid his hand upon the hunter's arm, as
though to put his threat of violence into execution;
but in doing so he made a great mistake. Boris was
fearless and independent; he was unaccustomed to
threats and interference. As a rule people were afraid
of him, and showed him deference: what right had
this man to browbeat and threaten him? Boris's hot
blood resented the insult, and in a moment the man
lay sprawling at his feet, bellowing loudly for help,
crying and swearing in a breath, in a manner which
is natural to the Russian peasant. His cries instantly
brought around the pair a host of serfs and servants,
who quickly hustled Boris within the passage, and
made as though they would lay hold of him. But this
the high-spirited hunter of bears would not submit
to, and, with his back to the wall, he hit out right
and left with so good effect that the number of his
assailants was considerably reduced in very quick
time indeed.</p>

<p>This was a row quite after Boris's own heart, and
he was thoroughly enjoying himself among the noisy
crowd of shouting and whining serving-men, when a
loud voice broke in above the noise&mdash;a voice that
Boris seemed to recognize, and at the sound of which
every other voice in that noisy hall died away into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
instant silence. The fallen assailants of Boris uprose
from the earth and ranged themselves in line, prepared
to denounce the foe or to excuse themselves
according as occasion arose. But the new arrival exacted
no explanations.</p>

<p>"Why," he cried, "it's my friend the bear-eater!
Come along this way, Bear-eater, and tell me all
about this disturbance. Have you killed so few
bears of late that you must needs work off your
spare energies at the expense of my poor servants?
Well, well, if you were to rid me of a score or two of
the thieving rogues, I should do well enough without
them, I daresay. But what is it all about?"</p>

<p>"The man with the embroidery wanted to give me
the knout because I asked for you by the name of
Petka," said Boris, feeling that there was more in all
this than he had quite understood. This must be
something like a barin, who could talk in so airy a
way of a "score or two" of his servants. "You said
your name was Petka, didn't you?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly," said the other, leading the way into
a private chamber; "Petka or Petrushka, sometimes
Peter&mdash;I answer to all these names. But come now,
to business. I like the look of you, Boris. I want
Russians with strong bodies and brave hearts; I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
have work for them. Do you feel inclined to enter
my service? I will pay you well if you serve me
well. Now, then, no wasting words, for I am due
down at the harbour&mdash;is it yes or no?"</p>

<p>"But I am not my own master," said the astonished
Boris. "I am the property of my barin, who employs
me to hunt the bears and wolves. I cannot say I will
leave him and serve you, though I like the look of
you well enough. Besides, what do you want me for&mdash;to
kill bears?"</p>

<p>"You shall hunt the bears to your heart's content,"
said the barin; "and as for your master, I will see
that he does not object to your transfer to my service.
Is it agreed? come, yes or no."</p>

<p>"Yes, then," said Boris, who both spoke and acted
as in a dream. The mastery of this young giant over
him seemed so complete that he could not have
answered otherwise than in the affirmative even if he
had wished to do so. He was drawn by a power
stronger than himself.</p>

<p>"Very well," said the other, writing rapidly, "excellently
well; shake hands upon it. Take this to
your master, and come to this place to enter upon
your service to-morrow morning. You may ask for
Piotr [Peter] Alexeyevitch, and I shall be ready to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
receive you. Now I must go sailing with Meinheer
de Kuyper. Stay; your hand-grip now. Good!
that's more like a grip than any I have felt for
some time. I shall like you, I think; only serve me
faithfully."</p>

<p>Peter Alexeyevitch, as he had called himself, left
the room with these words. But Boris preserved
somewhat painful reminiscences of his new friend
and master for several hours, for the return hand-grip
had been such that the bones of his hand had
ground together in the mighty clasp.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />

BORIS GOES A-SAILING.</h2>


<p>It was all very well for Boris to tell his new
friend that he would enter his service; but
when, away from the glamour of his presence, he
considered the matter in cold blood, it appeared to
him to be a somewhat audacious proceeding on his
part to coolly bring to his master a note from some
one else, whom he could only describe as a tall and
masterful young barin of the name of Peter Alexeyevitch,
stating that somebody proposed to deprive
his lawful lord of the services of his paid serf and
servant, the bear-hunter! Why, after all, should his
lord consent to so audacious a proposal from a total
stranger? There was no reason that Boris knew
why he should do so; in all probability he would
refuse, and perhaps punish Boris besides for his impertinence
and disloyalty in proposing such a thing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
or at least being a consenting party to such a proposal.
Hence Boris entered the barin's house at
Dubinka in some trepidation, and gave his letter
into the master's own hands, quite expecting an angry
reception.</p>

<p>"Well, Boris, so you killed one of the two bears,
I'm told," began the barin. "You've come for your
'tea-money,' I suppose? Well, you have deserved it
this time, and I shall pay it with pleasure. What's
this?&mdash;a letter? from whom?"</p>

<p>"That's what I can't tell your Mercifulness," said
Boris. "Petka, he calls himself, but I don't know
who he is, excepting that he is a gentleman like yourself,
and very big and strong&mdash;like me."</p>

<p>The barin took the letter and glanced at it; then
he flushed, and uttered an exclamation of surprise.
Then he laughed, and patted Boris kindly on the back.</p>

<p>"Bravo, Boris!" he said, "you have made a useful
friend. Do you know whom this letter is from?"</p>

<p>"From Petka, of course!" said blunt Boris.</p>

<p>"Your friend is the Tsar of all the Russias, my
son; and, moreover, he has requested me to transfer
you to his service. You are a lucky boy, Boris, and
I hope you may do your new master credit. Serve
him well. He is Peter, the Hope of the Nation; all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Russia looks to him, for he promises much. You are
a lucky fellow, Boris, and you may be a great man
yet."</p>

<p>Astonishment and wonder had caused the bear-hunter
to collapse into a chair, a liberty he would
never have thought of taking except under extraordinary
circumstances. The Tsar! it was actually the
Tsar himself who had stepped forward to save his
humble life. Boris pinched his leg to see whether he
was awake or asleep: it was all right, he was not
dreaming. And he had called him "Petka," and the
Tsar had not promptly cut off his head for the impertinence!
Perhaps he would to-morrow when he
went to the burgomaster's house in the morning.
And those were the Tsar's servants with whose whining
forms he had carpeted the floor of the entrance
hall! Assuredly he would pay for all this with his
head.</p>

<p>In a dazed condition Boris left the barin's presence,
and walked home to his father's cottage, wondering
whether it would not be wiser, on the whole, to disappear
into the depths of the forest until such time
as the Tsar should have left Archangel and returned
to Moscow? But worthier thoughts quickly succeeded
these promptings of cowardice. Boris recalled the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Tsar's kind words&mdash;he had taken a fancy to the
bear-hunter, he said; and again, "Russia had need of
strong arms and brave hearts!" If this was so, and
he could please the magnificent young Tsar by doing
it, he should unreservedly place his life and his
service at Peter's disposal.</p>

<p>The next morning found Boris once again at the
house of the burgomaster. This time the embroidered
functionary in charge of the front entrance, mindful
of his experience of the preceding day, was careful to
keep his conversation void of offence, and to preserve
a respectful demeanour to the owner of two such
powerful fists. Acting perhaps on orders received, he
ushered the young bear-hunter directly into the presence
of his new master.</p>

<p>Peter sat at a table, busily employed in manipulating
a model sailing-vessel, explaining the uses
of the various sails and other portions of the ship's
furniture to a stolidly attentive companion, who sat
and listened and smoked, and occasionally bowed his
head in assent to the propositions laid down by his
handsome young companion. There could not well
be a greater contrast between any two men than existed
between these two&mdash;the one, a short, thick-set,
squat-figured, Dutch-built caricature of a man; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
other, tall, far beyond the ordinary height of man,
straight as any one of all the millions of pines that
stood sentinel over his vast dominions, noble and
majestic, the very incarnate spirit of majesty.</p>

<p>Peter paused in his lesson to greet the new-comer.</p>

<p>"De Kuyper," he said, "look here! This is a fellow
who calls himself a bear-hunter, and I saw him
the other day running away from a bear for dear life,
like a hare from a hound&mdash;it was grand! If I had
not interfered, the bear would have deprived me of
the services of an excellent soldier, or sailor, or
keeper, or whatever I may decide to make of him&mdash;eh,
Boris?"</p>

<p>"I will serve your Majesty with my life blood in
whatever manner you may be pleased to use me,"
said Boris, kneeling before the young Tsar and touching
the ground with his forehead; "and I entreat
you to forgive my ignorance yesterday, and my impertinence
in treating you as little better than my
equal&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Nonsense," said Peter; "get up. I hate cringing
and all foolery. You shall show me what you are
good for; I shall see that you have ample opportunity.
Meanwhile let's have no talk about equality
or inferiority. You will find that they who serve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
me well are my equals in all but the name. For the
present you are my special body-servant, to attend
me wherever I go. And first you shall attend me on
board De Kuyper's ship, and we shall see what prospect
there is of making a sailor of you.&mdash;Come on,
De Kuyper, the wind is getting up. We shall have
a glorious sail.&mdash;Come on you too, Boris."</p>

<p>De Kuyper was the fortunate skipper of the first
foreign vessel which had entered the port of Archangel
during the present season, after the disappearance
of the ice had left the harbour open to arrivals
from abroad. Peter had instantly boarded the <i>Drei
Gebrüder</i> on its appearance, and having himself purchased
the cargo, and handsomely rewarded the skipper
and crew for their enterprise, carried away De
Kuyper to be his guest and favourite companion until
his departure from Archangel. Under the Dutch
skipper's guidance, Peter was laying the foundations
of that nautical experience which was so often to
stand him in good stead in after life.</p>

<p>Boris was no sailor&mdash;indeed, he had never been
fifty yards from the shore upon shipboard, though
he had ventured very much further in swimming.
His sensations, therefore, as the lumbering old vessel
plunged through the waves, were the reverse of enviable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Peter himself handled the rudder, and gave
all the necessary orders for managing the sails, insisting
upon Boris doing his share of the work in spite
of the misery of sea-sickness which sat heavily upon
the poor landsman.</p>

<p>It was a splendid day&mdash;hot on shore, but delightfully
cool and pleasant out at sea. The wind blew
freshly from the north and east, and Peter crowded
on all the sail he could. The clumsy old vessel,
squat-built and broad in the beam like her master,
strained and groaned beneath the weight of canvas,
but sped along at a rate which filled the young
Tsar's soul with the wildest delight. As usual, when
particularly happy, he was boisterous and very noisy,
poking fun at De Kuyper, Boris, and the sailors, and
from time to time singing snatches of his favourite
songs.</p>

<p>It so happened that a small boat which was attached
by a short length of tow-rope to the stern of
the <i>Drei Gebrüder</i> presently broke adrift, in consequence
of the strain, and floated away astern. The
young Tsar was annoyed. He loved a good boat,
and disliked to see one needlessly lost before his
eyes.</p>

<p>"De Kuyper," he shouted, "have you a swimmer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
on board? Send one of your Dutchmen after it!
Come, look sharp about it! They're not afraid surely?
Why, I'll go myself; see here!"</p>

<p>Before the horrified skipper could prevent him, the
rash young Tsar had thrown away his kaftan and
boots, and was in the act of mounting the bulwark,
when a strong hand seized his shoulder and pulled
him back. The Tsar flushed with anger, and raised
his big right hand to strike the man who had presumed
to take so great a liberty; but Boris pushed
back the lifted arm with a sweep of his own, leaped
upon a hen-coop near at hand, so to the bulwark of
the vessel, and in an instant was overboard, battling
with the waves, and making good progress towards
the fast-disappearing boat, now far astern. The Tsar's
face was all beaming with delight in a moment.</p>

<p>"De Kuyper!" he cried, "look at the lad&mdash;a
Russian lad, mind you, skipper; none of your Dutchmen!
Would your Dutchmen swim those waves?
I think not. I tell you, skipper, that bear-hunter
is a man after my own heart. Did you observe him
push me aside&mdash;glorious!&mdash;as though I had been the
cabin-boy? Oh, for ten thousand such Russians!"</p>

<p>De Kuyper grunted and took the rudder, which
Peter in his excitement had neglected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your bear-hunter had better look sharp and get
into that boat," he muttered, "for the sky looks squally,
and we shall have a knock-about before we reach
Archangel. The sooner we get him and the boat
aboard the better I shall be pleased!"</p>

<p>Boris meanwhile was fast gaining upon the lost
boat. Soon he had reached it and was hauling himself
over the side. The oars were safe, so that he had
little difficulty in propelling the small craft towards
the larger vessel, which had put about, and was now
coming round as quickly as possible, in order to take
up the recovered boat and its occupant.</p>

<p>With some considerable difficulty, owing to the
roughness of the sea, this was at last effected; and
Boris felt that he was amply repaid for the risk he
had run by the few words of the Tsar, and his mighty
grip of the hand.</p>

<p>"Bear-eater," he had said, "you are my brother;
let that be understood between us."</p>

<p>After this episode neither sea-sickness nor the discomfort
of sitting in wet clothes could divert the
mind of Boris from the thought of his exceeding
great joy. He had been called "brother" by the
young Tsar&mdash;the god-like Peter, who had been hailed
almost from his cradle as the hope of Russia; of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
whom even the unlettered Boris in far-off Archangel
had heard distant and indistinct rumours, as of some
prince of fairyland, come from no one knew where,
to work wonders for his empire, and astonish the
world by his power and magnificence! Now he had
seen this wonder of the age with his own eyes&mdash;he
had spoken with him&mdash;was his servant&mdash;had received
his approbation, nay, had been called "brother" by
him.</p>

<p>Boris, musing thus on his great good fortune,
suddenly became aware of a commotion on board.
A squall had violently struck the vessel, and she was
heeling over till her rail lay deep in the surging sea,
and her deck sloped like the side of one of his
beloved snow-hills. Peter, at the helm, was shouting
orders to the seamen, with his eyes fixed upon the
sails, while the vessel plunged and lay over till the
seas washed her fore and aft.</p>

<p>De Kuyper rushed to the rudder.</p>

<p>"Steady her&mdash;steady, Tsar!" he shouted, "or we
shall founder in a minute!"</p>

<p>Peter, wanting experience and unused to squalls
and emergencies, was thinking only of the splendid
excitement of rushing through the big waves as fast
as the ship could be made to go; the danger of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
moment was nothing to him. Perhaps he did not
realize it; he certainly did not heed it.</p>

<p>"Steady her, I tell you!" shrieked the skipper once
more. "Here; let me come! I won't go to the bottom
for a hundred Russian kings. Let go, I say!"</p>

<p>Peter's face flushed angrily.</p>

<p>"Keep away, De Kuyper, keep away," he cried;
"don't anger me. This is glorious!"</p>

<p>But De Kuyper knew that this was no time for
the politeness of courts and the deference due to
princes. He seized Peter by the shoulders and forced
him from the tiller.</p>

<p>"I'm skipper of this vessel," he shouted, "and I
intend to be obeyed while aboard of her. You shall
command when we get ashore, if we ever do!"</p>

<p>Peter let go his hold of the clumsy tiller-shaft,
looking for a moment like a thunder-cloud. During
that moment he revolved in his mind whether or
not he should take up that squat little Dutch skipper
in his great arms and throw him overboard; but
better impulses prevailed. The vessel quickly righted
under De Kuyper's experienced guidance, and flew
through the water actually quicker than before, and
upon a more even keel. In a moment Peter had
recovered his equanimity. He burst into a roar of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
laughter, and brought his big hand with a whack
upon the little Dutchman's shoulder.</p>

<p>"Skipper," he cried, in his hearty loud tones of
approval, "forgive me! You are a better sailor than
I am, and a plucky fellow to boot. I love a man who
stands up to me. You Dutchmen are a fine race, and
good sailors."</p>

<p>De Kuyper, the excitement over and the danger
past, was much upset by the recollection of his rudeness
to one who, though his inferior in the art of sailing,
was so immeasurably his superior in position and
importance. He apologized profusely and humbly,
and on his knees begged to be forgiven.</p>

<p>"Get up," said Peter, "and don't be a fool, skipper.
I liked you far better when you forced me away from
the tiller. I was a fool, and you told me so; that is
what I like in a man."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V.<br />

HOW PETER THE GREAT WAS KNOCKED
OVER.</h2>


<p>Before Boris had been very long in the service
of the Tsar he had become quite an expert
sailor; indeed, he and his young master were scarcely
ever absent from shipboard of one kind or another.
Archangel was at this time Russia's one outlet to the
sea. St. Petersburg was not yet built, nor Cronstadt
thought of; the Baltic ports had still to be wrested
from their proprietors; only the little northern port
at the mouth of the Dwina was open to receive the
ships and commerce of the world. Consequently,
as the season proceeded, vessels of all nationalities,
including English, appeared with their merchandise
at this distant market; and Peter passed many weeks
in the most congenial occupation of studying each
vessel that entered the port, sailing about in them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
making friends with their captains, and learning
everything he could gather of the history and circumstances
of the people to which each belonged. Boris,
too, learned many marvels concerning this planet of
ours and its inhabitants, undreamed of hitherto. The
young hunter was constantly in attendance on Peter&mdash;waited
upon him at dinner, slept at his door at night,
sailed with him, walked abroad with him, and was,
in a word, his inseparable companion.</p>

<p>The villagers at Dubinka greatly deplored the departure
of Boris from among them; for what were
they going to do without him when the winter-time
came round, and the wolves began to be both numerous
and assertive? Who was to keep them in check
now that the great Boris was gone? Even now they
had the best of reasons for acutely deploring the
hunter's absence. It will be remembered that whereas
there had been two bears engaged in the plundering
of the peasants' corn-fields, only one of these had been
accounted for by Boris before his departure. The
second bear had disappeared for some little time
after the death of its liege lord; but the days of her
mourning being now accomplished, she had reappeared,
and with appetite largely improved by her period of
abstinence. Her depredations became so serious at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
last that it was resolved by the council of the peasants
to send into the town a request to Boris to devote
his earliest leisure to a personal interview with the
widow of his late antagonist.</p>

<p>Boris received the message of the good folks of
Dubinka with delight. The very mention of a bear
aroused all his old sporting instincts, and he went
straight to the Tsar to obtain his permission to absent
himself for a day.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" laughed Peter. "So you want to be
eaten up again, do you? I doubt whether I can
spare you; you have made yourself too useful to me.
Had you not better stay? It is safer here."</p>

<p>Boris blushed. "The bear isn't born yet, sire," he
said, "that will make me run again. The bear you
killed had caught me napping. I shall never leave
my spear again, to eat strawberries."</p>

<p>"Well, well," said Peter, "you shall go on one
condition&mdash;that I go with you to see you safely
through with the adventure."</p>

<p>And so it came about that Boris and his master
walked out very early one summer morning to relieve
the peasants of Dubinka of their unwelcome visitor.
The two young giants called first at the house of the
<i>starost</i>, or principal peasant of the place, whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
aroused from his slumbers and carried off with them
into the fields at the edge of the forest, to show them
the exact spot at which the robber had concluded her
supper on the previous evening; for it was probable
that she would recommence her plundering at or about
the same spot. The starost brought the hunters to
the place they sought, approaching it in abject terror,
and scudding home again like a hare, lest the bear
should pursue him back over the fields.</p>

<p>Boris was the Tsar's master in their present occupation,
and thoroughly understood what he was about.
The pair concealed themselves in a dense clump of
cover at the edge of the wood. Just in front of their
ambush lay the oat-field last honoured by the attentions
of the bear. A large portion of it looked as
though a battle had been fought on it, so downtrodden
and crushed were the tall, delicate stalks.
It was arranged that Peter should hold the spear,
while Boris was to be content with the hunting-knife,
one which the Tsar had brought with him, a long
and business-like blade, both tough and sharp, as a
blade needs to be to be driven through the thick hide
of a bear. The young monarch was anxious to try
his "'prentice hand" with the spear, for he had never
handled one excepting on that memorable occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
when he gave the final push to the huge brute which
had first winded and then overpowered poor Boris.
The hunter very carefully explained the exact way in
which Peter must poise his body, how he must grip
the spear-shaft, and how he must plant his feet so
as to balance his body conveniently and at the same
time obtain a purchase with his heel which should
enable him to support any, even the greatest, strain.
Then the two men waited in silence for the arrival
of the widow of the late lamented Mr. Bruin.</p>

<p>It was still very early, about four o'clock. There
was no sound to break the repose of the young day,
save the boisterous song which now and again some
little bird set up for a moment, and as suddenly broke
off, finding itself to be the only singer. The pines
swayed solemnly in the faint morning breeze, sending
down showers of bright dewdrops far and wide. A
hare was playing quietly in the oat-field, quite unconscious
of the presence of its natural enemy, man;
and presently a proudly-clucking grouse walked out
with her brood into the oat-strown space beyond the
wood, and there demonstrated to her young hopefuls
how easily a breakfast could be picked up by people
who knew where to look for it. In the far distance
a family of cranes could be heard at intervals,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
exchanging confidences upon the adventures of the
past night and the delights of a hearty breakfast of
frog.</p>

<p>Suddenly, and without apparent reason, the hare
raised its head, sniffed the air, and in a moment was
scuttling full speed across the field, heading for the
village, as though it had remembered a message for
the starost which it had omitted to deliver while he
was on the spot. The careful grouse at the same
moment rose from the earth with a loud cluck, and
darted away, followed by her little brood. Over the
tops of the pines they went, far away into the heart
of the forest.</p>

<p>In another moment the reason for this abrupt departure
of bird and beast became apparent. Shuffling
awkwardly along, and mumbling in a querulous way
as she went, as though complaining that she had been
called up to breakfast earlier than was necessary, came
the wicked old widow-bear, marching straight for the
standing oats, as though everything in the district
belonged to her. She was a huge creature, a fitting
helpmate for the gigantic old warrior whom Peter had
slain. Slowly she picked her way along, swinging her
heavy body and half-turning her great head at each
step, looking alternately to right and to left in a perfunctory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
manner, as though making a concession to
the principle of precaution, while declining to believe
in the possibility of misadventure.</p>

<p>Boris's finger was at his lip, enjoining patience
and prudence, for the impulsive young Tsar was excited,
and quite capable of ruining the chances of a
successful hunt by doing something rash and ill-timed.
Boris touched the Tsar's arm and whispered.
Peter was to creep cautiously along and place himself
in the very spot at which the bear had issued from
the forest. When there, he was to hold his spear
ready for action and await events. Boris himself
would walk out into the oat-field, in full view of the
bear, who would probably not charge him. Most
likely she would hurry back to the cover, entering
the wood where she had left it; and if Boris could
influence her course, he would encourage her to
choose that particular direction. Then the Tsar
must suddenly step out from his ambush and receive
the bear upon his spear; and if matters went
smoothly, the impetus of her flight would bring her
down upon him, whether she liked it or not.</p>

<p>The plan of attack thus settled, Peter withdrew
under cover of the bushes and pine trunks to take up
the position assigned him, while Boris boldly stepped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
forth from his ambush, and made for a point beyond
the place where the bear was now busy gobbling
the grain greedily, and emitting grunts of satisfaction
and high content. So well occupied was she,
indeed, that she took no notice of the hunter's approach
until Boris was nearly level with her. Then
she raised her head with a grunt, and expressed her
surprise and displeasure in a loud roar. For a
moment it appeared likely that she would charge
Boris, who, having nothing but a hunting-knife
wherewith to defend himself, might in that event
have fared badly; for he would have died rather than
turn his back upon her and run, since Peter was at
hand to see. But timid counsels prevailed, and Mrs.
Bruin quickly determined to take the safer course.
She twisted her bulky body round, and made off, as
Boris had foretold, straight for the spot at which
she had left the forest. Boris ran after her, shouting,
in hopes of accelerating her speed; and in this
he was entirely successful. Straight down for the
Tsar's ambush she raced, and close at her heels went
Boris, shouting instructions to Peter as he sped. The
result of all this speed and excitement was that by
the time the great creature had reached the spot
where Peter awaited her, the impetus of her flight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
was so great that she was upon him, as he stepped
out to meet her, ere she had time to swerve sufficiently
to avoid him.</p>

<p>The Tsar had stepped forth at precisely the right
moment, and was ready with poised spear to receive
the rush. His feet had gripped the earth as tightly
as in the somewhat slippery condition of the ground
was practicable. With a roar the monster hurled
herself upon the spear-point, uttering a second and
very bitter cry as she felt the steel enter into her
vitals.</p>

<p>The shock of her rush was terrific. Peter, strong
as he was and firmly as he had planted himself, was
knocked off his feet in an instant, and ere Boris could
realize the full horror of the situation, the most
valuable life in all Russia lay at the mercy of an
enraged and maddened she-bear. Peter fell backwards;
but as the huge brute precipitated herself
upon the top of him, the good spear-shaft of seasoned
wood caught in the ground, and for a moment held
her suspended, so that she could reach her enemy
with neither teeth nor claws.</p>

<p>That moment saved the Tsar's life. Boris was
but a few yards behind, and it was the work of an
instant for him to cast himself headlong upon the
carcass of the roaring, blood-stained brute, and with
an accurately placed thrust of the knife in her throat
put an end in the nick of time to her cravings for
vengeance. With his additional weight thrown suddenly
into the scale the good spear-shaft snapped in
two, and bear and hunter together toppled over upon
the prostrate figure of Russia's Tsar.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you, Brother Boris," said the Tsar quietly,
rising from the ground and wiping the bear's blood
from his clothes. "It was well done; we are quits.
When you see me over-proud, my son, you shall remind
me of this morning, and how an old she-bear
sent me head over heels. Now let's get home to
breakfast."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />

A TASTE OF THE KNOUT.</h2>


<p>Thus were laid and cemented the foundations
of a friendship destined to last for many a
long, history-making year. Boris was a man after
Peter's own heart, and from those early Archangel
days until the end of their lives the two were rarely
parted for long, excepting when the exigencies of
public affairs necessitated the departure of one of them
for distant portions of the realm.</p>

<p>The summer in Archangel is a short one, and by
the end of August autumn is in full progress, with
icy warnings of winter at night-time. Peter the Tsar
had, besides, many important duties which called for
his presence at the capital, Moscow; and towards the
end of July it became necessary to bring his delightful
seaside holiday to an end, and return to sterner duties
at home. Peter decided to travel in a three-horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
<i>tarantass</i>, a springless carriage slung upon a pole instead
of springs&mdash;comfortable enough on soft country
roads, but desperately jolting on stony ones.</p>

<p>Boris had begged to be allowed to accompany his
beloved patron and friend, in order that he might
instruct the Tsar in the art of "calling" wolves and
perhaps lynxes, and thus while away a few of the tedious
hours of the long journey. Peter was delighted to
acquiesce in this arrangement; for if there was one
thing in the world that this most energetic of sovereigns
could not tolerate, it was to sit idle with no
possibility of finding food for observation for his eyes
or new facts and new ideas for assimilation in his
ever active and receptive brain. So the two posted
on in front of the long procession of servants and
luggage, comfortably housed in a covered tarantass,
drawn by three horses abreast, and driven by a notable
driver renowned for his skill in persuading that erratic
animal, the Russian pony, to move along faster
than had been its intention when it started. Ivan
arrived at this happy result by a judicious mixture
of coaxing and abuse, calling the ponies every pet
name in the Russian vocabulary at one moment, and
sounding the very depths and shoals of the language
of the slums at the next. Ivan was never silent for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
a moment, but spoke to his ponies incessantly; and
these latter generously decided as a rule that they
must do their best for such an orator.</p>

<p>Through the tumble-down villages of northern Russia
the tarantass flew, while the inhabitants stared round-eyed
as it passed, not dreaming for a moment that it
was their Tsar who glided by, but taking him for one
of the many traders who posted between the seaport
and the capital in tarantasses crammed with merchandise
of every description. Peter was well armed with
matchlock and pistols, for there was the possibility
of a <i>rencontre</i> with wolves or robbers, and it was well
to be prepared for every contingency.</p>

<p>The two young men frequently stopped at some
village <i>traktir</i>, or inn, as they passed, to refresh
themselves with a meal of peasant fare and a chat
with the village people, whose opinions about his
august self Peter loved to learn. Since they had not
the slightest idea of the identity of their questioner,
the Tsar gathered much information of great
value to himself in indicating which way, to use a
familiar expression, "the cat jumped" with regard to
popular opinion upon some of the important questions
of the day.</p>

<p>Most peasants, Peter found, were convinced that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the Tsar was more than human. Exaggerated versions
of his intelligence and vigour as child and boy had
reached them, and it was a common belief that the
young prince had been specially sent by Providence
to right the wrongs of the Russian people, and to
make life for the peasantry a sweet dream of marrow
and fatness and exemption from work.</p>

<p>The priests, on the other hand, had widely different
ideas upon the subject. The young Tsar, they said,
mournfully shaking their heads, was a fine young
fellow, no doubt, but his character was full of danger
for Holy Russia. He was too liberal and progressive.
Progress was the enemy of Russia and of the
Holy Church. Russia required no western civilization
imported within her peaceful borders. She was not
a secular country, but the specially favoured of the
church, and foreigners and foreign manners and so-called
civilization would be the curse of the country,
and Peter threatened to introduce both. He was all
for progress, and the priests did not believe in progress.</p>

<p>Occasionally discussion waxed warm at the traktirs
visited by the two young men, and once or twice
blows were exchanged.</p>

<p>Once a party of drunken peasants uproariously
declared that the Tsar Peter was a mere usurper, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
that if he had had his deserts he would have been
"put away" long since in some monastery or castle,
never more to be heard of. Peter flushed when he
heard this, for the question of his right to the throne
of Russia was always to him a sore point; whereupon
Boris, seeing that his master was annoyed, sprang up
and knocked the speaker down. The landlord then
rushed in, and finding that two strangers had set a
company of his regular customers by the ears, bade
them depart from his house that instant.</p>

<p>Peter laughed good-naturedly, but on the landlord
becoming abusive he seized the man by the neck and
trousers and pitched him upon the top of the stove.
Then Boris and the Tsar took the rest of the company,
who fought with drunken desperation, and pitched
them up, one after the other, to join the landlord,
until there were nine men in all huddled together on
the wide top of the stove, whining and afraid to
come down again.</p>

<p>Peter was perfectly good-humoured throughout,
and enjoyed the fun; but the landlord was naturally
furious, and when his two tall guests, having paid
their reckoning, left the house, he took the opportunity
of scrambling down from his prison and going for
the village policeman, whom he despatched at full<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
speed after the travellers. The policeman, being well
mounted, overtook the tarantass, and explained his
mission, when Peter immediately gave orders to the
driver to turn the horses' heads and return to the
village.</p>

<p>There the pair, to their great amusement and
delight, were placed in the village lock-up, pending
inquiries by the village council of peasants; and there
they still were when, with bells jingling, and horses
galloping, and dust flying, and with much shouting
and pomp, the Tsar's retinue drove into the place, and
pulled up at the traktir.</p>

<p>It so happened that the whole of Peter's late antagonists,
including, of course, the landlord, were still
present, having all by this time climbed down from
the stove. They were discussing, in the highest good-humour
and with much self-satisfaction, the promptitude
with which the landlord had avenged the insult
to his customers, and discussing also what punishment
would be suitable for the delinquents now confined in
the village lock-up. The arrival of the Tsar's retinue
broke up the deliberations, however, and the peasants
retired to the far end of the room in order to make
way for the crowd of kaftaned and uniformed servants
of the Tsar, who quickly monopolized all the tables<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and chairs, and settled themselves for a quarter of an
hour's rest and refreshment.</p>

<p>The visitors were noisy, and took to ill-using the
peasants and chaffing the irate landlord. One of
them threw a glass of vodka in his face, and asked
him if that was the only sort of stuff he had to offer
to gentlemen of quality? The landlord sputtered
and raged, and, in the pride of his late successful
capture of two travellers, threatened. His threats
largely increased the merriment of his guests, who
thumped him on the back and roared with laughter.
One seized him by the nose in order to cause his
mouth to open wide, when he dashed down his throat
the contents of a huge tumblerful of <i>kvass</i>, a kind
of beer very nauseous to any palate save that of a
Russian peasant. The poor landlord choked and
sputtered and abused, but succeeded in escaping out
of the room, returning, however, in a few minutes
armed with authority in the shape of the <i>ooriadnik</i>,
or village policeman, whom he requested instantly to
"arrest these men."</p>

<p>The little policeman glanced at the uproarious company
in a bewildered way. He was not a coward,
and he relied much upon the power of the law&mdash;of
which he was the embodiment&mdash;to overawe the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
minds of all good Russians. Besides, had he not, a
few minutes since, successfully arrested and locked
up two giants, in comparison with whom these noisy
people were mere puppets? He therefore pulled himself
together, and tentatively laid his hand upon the
arm of one who seemed to be quieter than the rest of
the party; he was smaller, anyhow, and would therefore
do very well to practise upon first. But the
man shook him off and warned him.</p>

<p>"Don't be a fool," he said; "get out of this and
let us alone. Don't you see we could strangle you
and the whole villageful of peasants if we pleased?
Go home while you can walk on two legs, and let us
alone!"</p>

<p>But the plucky little ooriadnik was not so easily
discouraged.</p>

<p>"You may threaten as much as you please," he
said, "but you will find I am not afraid of a party of
tipsy cowards like you. Why, it isn't half-an-hour
since I arrested, all by myself, a couple of fellows
three times your size. Didn't they fight, too!"</p>

<p>The Tsar's servants interchanged glances.</p>

<p>"Where are the two men you speak of?" some one
asked.&mdash;"What were they driving in, and where were
they coming from?" said another.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"They're in the village lock-up at this moment,"
said the ooriadnik; "and that's where you'll be in
another minute or two."</p>

<p>Some of the party looked serious, some burst into
roars of laughter, others started up excitedly.</p>

<p>"You must show us this lock-up first," said the
small person whose arrest was half accomplished; "we
can't submit to be huddled into a little hole of a place
incapable of holding more than the two you have
there already!"</p>

<p>"Oh, there's plenty of room for you, never fear!"
said the brave ooriadnik. "Come along, by all means,
and see for yourself!"</p>

<p>The policeman foresaw an easy way to effect the
arrest of at least one or two of those present, and
they would serve as hostages for the rest. He would
push them in as they stood at the door of the lock-up,
and fasten the bolt upon them!</p>

<p>So the whole party adjourned to the lock-up. The
door was opened, and there, to the horror of his
frightened servants, sat the Tsar of all the Russias,
unconcernedly playing cards with Boris the Bear-Hunter.</p>

<p>One official instantly seized the ooriadnik by the
throat and pinned him to the wall; another performed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the same service on the landlord. Others
threw themselves upon the floor at Peter's feet and
whined out incoherent reproaches that their beloved
sovereign should have trusted himself to travel so
far in advance of his faithful servants and guards,
and thus lay himself open to outrage of this description.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Peter; "what's all
the disturbance about? Let those men go. Get up,
all you fools there, and stop whining; there's no
harm done.&mdash;Listen, Mr. Landlord. You have had me
arrested; very well, here I am. I am the Tsar; but
what of that? If I have done wrong, I desire to
be treated just as any other delinquent would be
treated. Call your village council together, and let's
have the inquiry over as quickly as possible. We
must push on!"</p>

<p>The landlord, followed by the ooriadnik, both in
tears and with loud lamentations, threw themselves at
Peter's feet, asking his pardon and pleading ignorance
of his identity with their beloved Tsar. But Peter
insisted upon being treated exactly as any other
offender, and the <i>moujiks</i> of the community were
convened as quickly as possible to the village court.
All these, including the persons whose upheaval upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
the stove had been the original cause of all the disturbance,
came in terror for their lives&mdash;most of
them loudly weeping&mdash;for there was not one but
made sure that the lives of every moujik in the
village must of necessity be forfeit, since so terrible
an outrage and insult had been inflicted upon the
Tsar.</p>

<p>Peter bade the landlord state his case, and instructed
the starost, or elder of the community, to
question both accuser and accused according to the
usual procedure of the village court. But it appeared
that both landlord and starost were far too frightened
to find their tongues. Then the Tsar took upon
himself to state the case. He and his body-servant,
he explained, had violently assaulted the landlord of
the inn, together with certain of his customers. There
had been provocation, but nevertheless the assault
was undoubtedly committed. What was the penalty
for assault?</p>

<p>The starost, to whom the Tsar addressed this remark,
burst into tears and knelt with his forehead tapping
the floor at Peter's feet. All the moujiks followed suit,
and for some minutes there was naught to be heard
save groanings and whinings and bits of the litany
in use in the Russo-Greek Church. But neither the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
starost nor any of his peers of the community offered
a reply.</p>

<p>"Speak up, man!" said the Tsar angrily, and then
immediately bursting into one of his loud guffaws.
"What's the penalty for assault? Speak! I am determined
to be told, and by yourself."</p>

<p>Once more the entire company of peasants made as
though they would throw themselves upon the ground
and whine and pray as they had done before; but
when Peter angrily stamped upon the floor, they all,
with one accord, renounced the intention and stood
quaking in their places.</p>

<p>"Come, come," said Peter impatiently; "don't be a
fool, man. You are here to state the law, and you
shall state it! What is the penalty for assault?"</p>

<p>The wretched starost strove to speak, but his lips
would not open. He essayed once again, and this
time succeeded in whispering,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your High Mercifulness&mdash;pardon&mdash;it is ten cuts
of the knout."</p>

<p>Then his legs failed him once more, and he fell,
together with his moujiks, upon the floor, weeping
and wailing, and calling upon the Tsar and upon
Heaven for mercy. When the hubbub had in part
subsided, Peter spoke again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Very well," he said. "Ooriadnik, do your duty.
Don't be afraid; I prefer to see duty fearlessly done.
Take your knout and lay on!"</p>

<p>The unfortunate ooriadnik was sufficiently master
of himself to comprehend that it was useless to resist
when the Tsar's will had once been expressed. He
took his knout in his nerveless hand, and with white
face and haggard expression tapped the Tsar's back
the necessary number of times, inflicting strokes which
would hardly have caused a fly, had one of these
insects happened to settle upon Peter's broad back,
to raise its head and inquire what the matter was.
Then he threw down his knout and grovelled at the
Tsar's feet, begging forgiveness.</p>

<p>"Nonsense, man," said Peter, but kindly; "finish
your work first, and then we can talk of other
matters.&mdash;Now, Boris, your turn.&mdash;Lay on, ooriadnik,
and put a little more muscle into it; this fellow's
skin is as hard as leather!"</p>

<p>The ooriadnik, intensely relieved by the Tsar's
evident good-humour, laid on with some vigour, and
flogged poor Boris in a manner not entirely agreeable
to the hunter's feelings, who, nevertheless, did not
flinch, though he felt that the young Tsar's manner
of amusing himself was somewhat expensive to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
friends. Boris lived to learn that this was so indeed.
Nothing ever pleased Peter more than to enjoy a
hearty laugh at the expense of his familiar companions.</p>

<p>But the ooriadnik's duties were not yet concluded.
The Tsar patted him kindly on the back. "Bravo,
ooriadnik!" he cried; "you are improving.&mdash;Now,
then, you gentlemen who threw vodka and kvass
at the landlord of the traktir, step out.&mdash;Lay on
again, ooriadnik, and teach these persons not to waste
good vodka!"</p>

<p>Then those servants found that they had committed
an error in having assaulted the landlord;
for the ooriadnik, having warmed to his work, and
remembering the laughter and contempt with which
his authority had been treated by these men at the
inn, laid on his blows with such good will that the
unfortunate culprits howled for mercy, to the huge
delight of the Tsar.</p>

<p>After which object-lesson upon the impartiality of
true justice, and the duty of respect towards the
powers that be, Peter and his retinue resumed their
journey.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a><br />

A RACE FOR LIFE.</h2>


<p>It has been already mentioned that Boris had
promised to instruct his master in the art of
calling various animals. In this art Boris was marvellously
expert, and could imitate the cry of the
wolf, lynx, and other creatures so exactly that if any
member of the particular family whose language he
was imitating chanced to be within hearing, it would
invariably respond to his call&mdash;sometimes to its destruction,
if it did not find out in time that it had
been made the victim of a gross deception. The
practice of this art was a source of unfailing delight
and amusement to the Tsar during that weary drive
of hundreds of miles through the plains and forests of
northern and central Russia; for most of the journey
was performed by land, though the Dwina offered a
good water-way for a considerable distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>The aptitude of Boris for imitation extended to the
calling of birds as well as beasts, and many were the
tree-partridges that were lured by him to their doom,
and subsequently eaten by the monarch with much
enjoyment as a welcome change from the sour cabbage-soup
and black bread and salt, which were for
the most part all that the party could get to subsist
upon.</p>

<p>It was rarely, indeed, that wolf or lynx ventured
to approach close enough to the carriage of the Tsar
to permit of a successful shot with his old matchlock;
but these animals, wolves especially, were frequently
seen at a distance, appearing for an instant amid the
gloom of the dense pines, but rapidly disappearing as
soon as they had ascertained that they had been deceived.
But once, when within two or three days'
journey of Moscow, this now favourite pastime of the
Tsar came near to involving himself and Boris in a
fate which would have saved the present writer the
trouble of following any further the fortunes of Boris,
and would have caused the history of Russia, and
indeed that of Europe, to be written in an altogether
different manner, for the stirring pages of the life
and work of Peter the Great would never have been
penned at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris, as usual, was reclining easily in the front seat
of the travelling carriage, idly smoking and chatting,
and now and again, at the bidding of Peter, who
occupied the back seat, sending out loud invitations
in wolf language, in the hope that some wandering
member of the family might happen to be within call
and respond to his advances. Of a sudden Boris's
cries were answered; a melancholy howl was distinctly
heard by both men to proceed from within
the heart of the dense forest through which the road
lay. The howl appeared to proceed from a distance
of half-a-mile, and was instantly followed by a second
a little further away. The Tsar quickly sat up, gun
in hand, while Boris excitedly reiterated his cries,
producing tones so pathetically melancholy that the
wolf would be hard-hearted indeed that could resist
so touching an appeal for companionship. To his
surprise, however, there came not one reply but
several; half-a-dozen wolves, seemingly, had heard the
invitation, and were hastening to respond to it. This
was splendid. The young Tsar was now extremely
excited.</p>

<p>"Howl away, Boris," he whispered; "there are
several of them. We are sure of a shot this time!"</p>

<p>Nothing loath, Boris continued his howlings, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
each repetition the number of wolves that took part
in the responding calls appeared to increase, until
some twenty distinct voices could be made out, each
coming from a slightly different quarter.</p>

<p>Ivan the driver turned half round and crossed
himself; then he spat on the ground&mdash;a sure sign
of discontent in a Russian; then he addressed the
young Tsar with the easy familiarity of an old Russian
servant.</p>

<p>"Stop it, Peter, the son of Alexis," he said; "there
are too many wolves here! My horses will lose their
heads if they see them.&mdash;Don't howl any more, Boris
Ivanitch, if you love your life!"</p>

<p>Boris himself was looking somewhat grave, for he
was well aware of the truth of old Ivan's remark
that there were too many wolves&mdash;it was a pack, not
a doubt of it; and the character of wolves when in
a pack is as different from that of the same animals
when alone or in pairs as is the harmless malevolence
of a skulking beggar in the streets compared with the
mischief-making capacity of an armed and howling
mob of roughs and blackguards. But the Tsar had
never seen a pack of wolves, and knew little of the
dangers of which both Boris and Ivan were well
aware; therefore he directed the former to continue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
his calls, bidding Ivan, at the same time, keep a proper
hold upon his horses if he was afraid of them.</p>

<p>Old Ivan crossed himself once more and spat a
second time, but he gathered up the reins as the Tsar
commanded. As for Boris, he looked graver than
ever, and howled in a half-hearted manner.</p>

<p>In a very few moments the vanguard of the wolf-host
made its appearance. First one gaunt, gray-pointed
snout appeared amid the pines on the right
of the road, then another; almost at the same instant
three cantering forms hove into view close behind;
and two more were seen taking a survey in front
of the horses' heads.</p>

<p>Peter was in a high state of excitement; he thought
nothing of the danger of the moment&mdash;it is doubtful
whether he realized it. His gun-barrel was raised and
pointed now at one gray form, now at another, as
each in turn appeared to offer a better chance of a
successful shot. Just as he fired, however, the horses
had caught sight of the leaders of the pack, but a
few paces from their noses, and the sudden apparition
so startled them that all three shied with one accord,
bringing the wheel of the tarantass into a gigantic
rut, and so nearly upsetting the carriage that the gun
flew out of Peter's hands as he clutched at the side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the vehicle to save himself from being pitched
out.</p>

<p>The next instant the horses, entirely beyond the
control of poor Ivan, were dashing along the road at
full gallop, the wolves accelerating their easy canter
in order to keep up. It now became apparent that
there were many more of these grim-looking creatures
present than had at first seemed to be the case; indeed,
the wood on either side of the roadway appeared to
swarm with their gaunt figures, while numbers followed
behind, and a few headed the carriage. Even
Peter, now that his gun was lost to him, began to feel
that the position was not so agreeable as he had
thought; while Boris said little, but watched gravely
the slightest movement of the leaders of the wolf-mob,
loosening the knife at his side the while and
bidding Peter do the same.</p>

<p>"How far to the next post-station, Ivan?" the
Tsar shouted presently.</p>

<p>"Twelve versts," Ivan shouted back, without turning
his head.</p>

<p>It was all the old man could do to keep the horses'
heads straight; so mad were they with terror that
they would have rushed wildly into the forest at the
side of the road if permitted to do so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>Twelve versts are eight English miles, and Boris
was well aware that the wolves would be unlikely to
content themselves with passively following or accompanying
the carriage for so great a distance; they
would, he knew, attack the horses before very long,
for their excitement would carry them away into what
wolves with cool heads would consider an indiscretion.
Occasionally a wolf would push ahead of its fellows,
impelled by the desire to have the first taste of blood,
advancing its gray nose so close to the side of the
carriage that Boris or his master was able to aim a
vicious dig at it, and once or twice a howl of pain
attested to the fact that the blow had reached and
either scratched or gashed the indiscreet assailant.</p>

<p>And so, for several miles, matters remained.
Boris began to take heart, for half the journey had
been accomplished, and if nothing more serious were
attempted by the wolves than had been ventured by
them up till now, there was no reason to fear any evil
consequences. The wolves would pursue them thus up
to within a few yards of the village, and then slink
back into the woods to reflect upon what might have
been had they been more enterprising.</p>

<p>Peter clearly shared the favourable view of Boris;
no gloomy fears oppressed his sturdy mind. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
laughed as he gashed at the trespassers, calling them
all the bad names in the Russian vocabulary, including
"cholera," which is a favourite term of abuse in
that country, for sufficiently apparent reasons, and
"Pharaoh," which, with less obvious point, is to a
Russian the most irritating and offensive of all the
bad names you can call him.</p>

<p>But while the two young men were thus busily
engaged in the hinder portion of the carriage, a cry
from old Ivan on the box caused them to desist from
their exciting occupation and to look ahead. Not a
moment too soon had the old driver uttered his warning
note. Three huge wolves had pushed in front of
their fellows and had commenced their attack upon
the horses, just as Boris had feared would be the case.
The fierce brutes were leaping up on either side, attempting
to seize the horses by the throat, but making
their springs as yet in a half-hearted way, as though
they had not quite worked themselves up to the necessary
point of audacity. The poor horses, however,
at each spring of their assailants, jerked up their
heads in terror, losing their step, and thus causing
a new danger, for at the present rate of speed a
stumble from any of the three might have had fatal
results to the occupants of the carriage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris realized the danger in a moment. Quickly
directing his companion to remain where he was and
attend to the attack from the rear, he sprang upon
the coach-box, and thence upon the back of the shaft-horse.
The other two horses were attached to the
carriage by pieces of rope only, fastened to leather
collars about their necks; and it was these two outsiders
against whose flanks and throats the wolves
were now directing their attacks. Boris with difficulty
obtained a position upon the back of one of them,
lying along its spine and hitching his feet into the
rope at either side, while he clasped the leather collar
with one hand and held his long sharp knife in the
other. In this awkward and insecure position he
managed to slash at the wolves, two of which were
now making determined springs, as though resolved at
all hazards to pull the unfortunate horse down and
put an end to this prolonged chase.</p>

<p>It was a good fight. Boris aimed his blows well,
and before a couple of hundred yards had been covered
one of the rash assailants, leaping rather higher than
before, received a dig from the big knife that sent
him yelping and somersaulting among his fellows, and
a detachment of them quickly fell behind to eat him
up. This did not affect the rest, however, and Boris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
found that he had about as much as he could do to
beat off the constantly increasing number of assailants.</p>

<p>Meanwhile another warning from old Ivan caused
Boris to look up for a moment, when he became aware
that the second outsider was in need of instant
assistance. A large wolf had succeeded in effecting
for a moment a hold upon the throat of the poor brute,
which had, however, either shaken or kicked it off
again with its galloping front legs. Peter was fully
occupied in beating off the increasingly audacious
attacks of the rearguard, while Ivan could, of course,
give him no assistance. Boris quickly made up his
mind that something must be done, and that instantly,
or one of the horses must inevitably be pulled down,
with fatal results to all parties. Thereupon Boris
slashed with his knife the rope which attached the
left-hand horse; and as the animal, feeling itself free,
darted towards the forest, he was pleased to see that
it was immediately followed by a dozen gray pursuers,
which were thus drawn away from the main body.
Horse and assailants quickly disappeared among the
trees, whither the historian is unable to follow them,
and the last tragedy of that steed, and its escape or
death, was played out far away in the heart of the
pine forest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>And now recommenced that fierce fight between
Boris and his numerous antagonists which had been
interrupted for a moment by the last recorded incident.
Deftly as Boris fought, the wolves were so aggressive
and numerous that it soon became apparent to the
hunter that they were gaining ground upon him, and
that in all probability they would succeed before long
in pulling down one of the two remaining horses,
which he was striving so determinedly to defend.
Boris was accustomed to make up his mind quickly
in cases of emergency. He shouted back to the Tsar
to hand up to Ivan the long bear-spear which was
strapped to the side of the tarantass. With this
weapon he directed Ivan to prod at those wolves
which attacked the shaft-horse, while he himself confined
his attention to those whose springs were aimed
at the remaining outsider. Old Ivan rose to the
occasion; he gathered the reins in one hand, and with
the other struck manfully at the brutes which ever
swarmed at flank and throat of the poor shafter.
Some of his blows grazed the horse's shoulder and
neck, causing it to rush on with even greater speed.
The post-village was now but a mile away, and if
only Boris could keep off the swarming brutes for
a few minutes longer the Tsar would be safe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 584px;">

<i>Page <a href="#Page_81">81</a>.</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>On flew the horses, and on hacked Boris; while
Peter, in the carriage, slashed at the hindmost wolves,
and old Ivan prodded bravely and shouted loudly at
those in front. If things were to go wrong, and
he should be unable to keep the leaders at bay
until the Tsar was in safety, Boris knew what he
would do.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the chase went on for another half-mile.
Then the outside horse, harassed beyond endurance by
the ever-increasing number of his assailants, stumbled
repeatedly. In an instant Boris had slashed in
two the cords which attached him to the vehicle,
and freed from the incubus of the carriage, the poor
animal darted forward and turned aside into the
forest, Boris himself still lying full length upon its
back, but assuming as quickly as he could a sitting
posture. In this position, still slashing at the wolves
which swarmed about him, and waving adieu to the
Tsar with his left hand, he disappeared from sight;
and in the distance the horrified Peter heard the
clatter of his horse's hoofs as the devoted hunter was
borne away from him to his doom.</p>

<p>For one wild moment Peter was for bidding Ivan
direct the carriage in pursuit; but the absurdity of
such a course was apparent on the face of it, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
Tsar was obliged, with grief and reluctance, to leave
his faithful servant and friend to his fate. At least
half the wolves or more had followed Boris into the
depths of the forest, and Peter and Ivan together
succeeded in keeping the rest at bay long enough to
allow the panting shafter to drag the carriage in
safety to within sight of the village, when, with a
gasp of despair, the poor creature stumbled and fell,
causing the carriage to stop suddenly with a jolt that
almost unseated the driver. Peter, with that personal
courage in which he has never been surpassed, leaped
out to cut the traces and allow the gallant animal
which had served him so well to gallop for life.
Seeing him on foot, the wolves, unable even now to
overcome altogether their natural terror of man,
drew off for a moment, and in that moment Peter
freed the horse, which dashed madly away into the
woods like its fellows, followed by all the wolves
with the exception of two or three which preferred
to hang about the two men as they walked on towards
the village, but not daring to approach within striking
distance of spear or knife. When within a few yards
of the first dwelling-house of the village, these disappeared
into the forest also, looking round once or
twice ere they finally retreated, and licking their lips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
as though their imagination dwelt upon the delights
of a feast that might have been.</p>

<p>The Tsar was morose and silent; and his attendants,
who arrived within an hour after himself, and
who declared that they had met neither wolves
nor Boris, left the young monarch to his supper,
avowing to one another that they had never yet seen
the Tsar so terrible to look upon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />

BORIS AND HIS FELLOW-OFFICERS.</h2>


<p>The young Tsar was himself surprised, as he sat
alone at his evening meal, to find how very
heavily the loss of poor Boris weighed upon him. He
had scarcely realized how closely the young hunter
had wound himself already around his heart&mdash;a
heart which, in spite of its hardness and waywardness,
was capable of forming the warmest attachments.
Peter was all through his life on the look-out for men
who were after his own ideal, and upon whom he
could rely for assistance in carrying out the vast
schemes and plans for the good of his people, and the
development and aggrandizement of his country, with
which his brain was filled from the first. Such a
man Peter thought he had found in Boris&mdash;one upon
whose absolute faithfulness he could rely, and whose
courage, as he had seen already more than once, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
equal to any emergency. He felt that he could
have trained Boris to be the ideal man for his purposes,
to be employed far or near with equal confidence,
and in any capacity that seemed good to his
employer; and instead, here was the poor fellow gone
already, a martyr to his devotion to himself! "Why
are there not more of my poor Russians like this
one?" thought the young Tsar; "and where am I
to lay my hand upon such another&mdash;even <i>one</i>?" It
certainly was most unfortunate and deplorable; so
no wonder the Tsar's servants found their master in
his most dangerous mood, and left him, as soon as
might be, to himself.</p>

<p>Peter ate his cabbage-soup, and sighed as he ate.
Why had he not anticipated the sudden action of
Boris, and sternly forbidden him to sacrifice himself&mdash;ah,
why indeed? Peter was not accustomed to
personal devotion of this sort. He had not come
across a Boris before this one, or he might have
guessed what the brave fellow would do, and could
have pulled him back into the carriage at the last
moment. He would rather have fed those thrice-accursed
gray brutes upon the whole of his retinue
than that they should have feasted upon that brave
heart. Poor Bear-Hunter! he had killed his last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
bear. What a fight there must have been at the very
last before he permitted the skulking brutes to crowd
around and pull him down!</p>

<p>Wrapped in these sad reflections, Peter sat before
his neglected bowl of soup, when of a sudden the
door opened, and the apparition of the very subject
of his dismal reflections stood before him. Bootless,
dishevelled, and with his clothes, what was left of
them, blood-stained and in rags, was it the ghost of
Boris as he had appeared at his last moment on
earth? Peter was not superstitious, wonderfully little
so for a Russian, but for a full minute he gazed in
doubt and uncertainty upon the apparition before him.
Then he burst into one of his very loudest guffaws.</p>

<p>"Boris!" he cried. "Yes! it is certainly Boris.
Come here, my brother. I was already mourning
you for dead. How did you escape those accursed
gray brutes? Here is a hunter indeed! Come here,
my brother." Peter kissed his friend upon both
cheeks; then administered a pat on the back which
might have felled an ox, laughed aloud once more,
and poured into a tumbler an immense draught of
strong vodka. "There," he said, "sit down and drink
that, my tsar of hunters, and tell me all about it."</p>

<p>"There's little to tell your Majesty," said Boris,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
taking a big sip at the spirits. "God was very
merciful to me; and as the wolves rushed in and
dragged the poor horse down, which they did almost
immediately after I left you, I grabbed at the branch
of a pine and hauled myself up out of their reach
just in time&mdash;not quite in time to save my boots,
in fact; for two active fellows jumped up and
pulled them both off my legs. I hope they choked
the brutes! Afterwards I settled myself comfortably
in the branches of the tree, and threw fir-cones at
them while they pulled poor Vaiska the horse to
pieces and fought over his carcass. In five minutes
there was not as much of Vaiska left as would make
a meal for a sparrow. When they had eaten Vaiska,
they sat around my tree, watching me and hoping
that I should soon let go and fall into their jaws. I
howled at them in their own language instead, and
they howled back at me. What I said seemed greatly
to excite them, for they ran round the tree, and
jumped up at me, and licked their lips. I climbed
down to a point just above that which they could
reach by leaping, and there I reclined at my ease and
slashed at them with my knife as long as they were
inclined for the game. When they grew tired of it,
they sat round the tree licking their chops and looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
up at me, and we exchanged complimentary
remarks at intervals in their language.</p>

<p>"After a while the rumble and jingle of the carriages
of your Majesty's retinue was heard approaching.
The wolves pricked up their ears to listen. They
made as though they would go back to the road at
first, in the hope of picking up more horse-flesh&mdash;greedy
brutes! as if Vaiska was not enough for them&mdash;but
thought better of it, there was so much noise
and rattle; and as the carriages came nearer and
nearer, they grew more and more anxious, until at
length, with a final chorus of abuse levelled at me
as I sat up in my perch, they one after the other
retired into the wood. Then I came down and ran
for the village; and here I am, alive to serve your
Majesty for many a long year, I trust."</p>

<p>"Glad am I to see you, my prince of hunters," said
the Tsar earnestly. "But what of your wounds&mdash;is
there anything serious? You look as though you
had been half-way down their throats; you must
have had a nasty gash somewhere to have got all
that blood on you. Call the surgeon and let him
see to it. I can't afford to lose so much of your
good blood, my Boris; Russia has not too much of
the right quality."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris laughed, and glanced at his saturated shirt
and waistcoat. "It's all wolf's blood," he said, "and
I wish there were more of it; I haven't a scratch."
And this was the simple truth.</p>

<p>So ended happily an adventure which came near
to depriving Russia of her greatest son and me of a
hero.</p>

<p>Two days after this the Tsar with his following
reached the capital, and Boris was given a commission
in one of the Streltsi regiments, while retaining his
place at the side of his master as body-attendant.
In the ranks of the Streltsi our hunter soon learned
the simple drill which the soldiers of the Russia of
that day had to acquire. The Streltsi were at this
time practically the only regular regiments of the
country, though they were not destined to remain so
long under the progressive rule of their present enlightened
Tsar. Being the one armed power in the
state, and having on several occasions successfully
taken advantage of their position, the Streltsi had
been loaded with privileges wrung from rulers and
statesmen who were afraid of them, and their present
position was most enviable. The men were allowed
to marry, and to live at their private homes; to carry
on any business or trade they pleased by way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
adding to the substantial incomes which they already
enjoyed at the expense of the state; and, in a word,
to do very much as they liked as long as they attended
the easy drills and parades which the regulations
enjoined. Hence Boris had plenty of time to
spare from his military duties to devote to attendance
upon his beloved master.</p>

<p>Peter had a double object in placing Boris in a
Streltsi regiment. He was anxious that the hunter
should learn all that there was to be learned in so poor
a military school of the life and duties of the soldier;
but chiefly because he had good reason to mistrust
the Streltsi as a body, and it suited his purpose to
distribute a few of his more enlightened and devoted
adherents among the various regiments, in order that
he might rest assured that in case of disaffection
among the troops he would hear of it at the first
whisper. Peter had not forgotten a certain horrible
scene of violence enacted before his eyes by these
very regiments in the days of his early childhood,
when the entire corps had revolted, and, in presence
of himself and his young co-Tsar, had massacred their
chiefs and others in the square of the palace of the
Kremlin. It is probable that, young as he had been
at that time, Peter never forgave the Streltsi for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
terrible experience, and that his distrust of them as
a danger to the state dated from that day. Growing
as time went on, his hatred of them culminated in
the horrors attending their ultimate extermination,
to which brief reference will be made at a later stage
of this narrative.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Boris hastened to acquire all that he
could pick up of military knowledge. He did not
like this city life, accustomed as he was to the free
and healthy open-air existence of the old Dubinka
days, neither did he like his fellows in the Streltsi
regiment to which he had been appointed; but it
was enough for our faithful hunter to know that it
was the Tsar's desire that he should associate with
these men: so long as he could render service to his
beloved master, Boris was content. Nor, in truth,
was Boris popular with his comrades. It was well
known that the new-comer was the <i>protégé</i> and favourite
of the Tsar, and he was distrusted on this
account; for the conscience of the regiment was not
altogether void of offence towards the young head
of the realm, and it was more than suspected that
Peter had on that very account placed Boris as a
kind of spy upon their inner counsels.</p>

<p>The reason for the dislike entertained by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Streltsi for their Tsar was this:&mdash;The elder brother
of Peter, Ivan, was still alive and physically in good
health; but, as is well known, though he had acted
at one time as co-Tsar with Peter, Ivan was quite
incapable, by reason of the weakness of his intellect,
of taking any real part in the government of the
country, and Peter, by his own brother's earnest
wish, as well as by the expressed desire of the
nation, had assumed the sole authority over the
destinies of the country. The Streltsi, full of their
own importance as the actual backbone of the state,
and on this account "busy-bodies" to a man, were
never perfectly satisfied with this state of affairs, and
evinced at all times a nervous anxiety as to their
duty in the matter. Ivan, they considered, was the
real Tsar or Cæsar, successor to the Byzantine and
Roman Cæsars, and therefore the lord, by divine right,
of Holy Russia. It mattered little that he was
incompetent and unwilling to govern; that was regrettable,
no doubt, but it did not justify another,
either Peter or any one else, sitting in his place and
holding a sceptre which did not belong to him. The
Streltsi were probably perfectly honest in their
opinions. They had nothing to gain by a revolution;
their position was assured, and a very good position<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
it was. It was the feeling of responsibility which
weighed upon them, and filled them with a restless
sense that they ought by rights to interfere.</p>

<p>Peter, acute as he was, undoubtedly realized the
exact state of affairs, and was well aware that a constant
danger of trouble with his Streltsi regiments
stood in the way of the many reforms and projects
with which his active brain teemed at all times;
and it is probable that he was on the look-out even
now for a plausible excuse to rid himself of an incubus
which he felt was inconsistent with his own ideas
of the fitness of things and with the spirit of the
times. Boris was therefore, more or less, that very
thing which the regiment believed him to be&mdash;namely,
a spy upon their actions and intentions.</p>

<p>The hunter was far too simple-minded to comprehend
that this was his position. As a matter of fact,
unlettered peasant as he was, he knew little of the
history of the last few years. He was aware, indeed,
of the existence of Ivan, but he had no suspicion
whatever of the good faith of his companions towards
the Tsar; all of which became, moreover, so apparent
to his fellow Streltsi, that they soon learned to look
indulgently upon "simple Boris," as he was called, as
one who was too much a fool to be a dangerous spy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
Hence, though never openly airing their views before
their latest recruit, the young officers of the regiment
gradually began to disregard the presence of Boris,
and to indulge in hints and innuendoes referring to
the matter which they had at heart, even though Boris
was in the room and sharing in the conversation.</p>

<p>Now Boris, as is the case with many others, was
by no means such a fool as he looked. He heard
references to matters which he did not understand,
and which he knew he was not intended to understand.
He observed frequently that parties of officers seated
dining at the eating-houses frequented by the regiment
would glance at him as he entered the room and
moderate their loud tones to a whisper. He overheard
such sentences as&mdash;"The priests count for much, and
they are with us!" or again, "Who is to persuade the
Grand Duke that his brother is a mere usurper?"
And once Boris thought he caught the Tsar's name,
as he entered the room, received with groans, and
striding to the table with flushed face, asked whose
name the company had received with these manifestations
of dislike; whereupon the Streltsi officers had
laughed aloud, and replied that they had spoken of
a dog which had stolen a bone that didn't belong
to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>The simple-minded Boris laughed also, and said,
"What dog?"</p>

<p>Whereat the company roared with laughter, and
the major replied with streaming eyes,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, a big dog I saw up at the Kremlin, that
found a little dog with a nice bone, and bow-wowed
at him till the little dog thought he had better let it
go with a good grace. We all thought this so mean
of the big dog that we hooted him and drank his
health backwards!"</p>

<p>Afterwards Boris recalled this and other curious
sayings of his companions, and revolved them in his
mind as he lay at the Tsar's door at night.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />

ONE SWORD AGAINST FIVE.</h2>


<p>The result of Boris's reflections was that he became
suspicious and unhappy. He felt that
his position was a delicate and difficult one, and that
it would be impossible for him to maintain it under
present conditions. Putting two and two together, he
had concluded that there was something existing in
the minds of his brother officers to which he was no
party, and which he feared&mdash;though he hesitated to
believe it&mdash;might be treason against his beloved master.
If this should prove to be the case, he reflected, what
course ought he to pursue? Should he inform the
Tsar, and thus be the means of terrible trouble to the
regiment of which he was a member, or allow matters
to take their course in the hope that either his suspicions
would prove unfounded, or that his companions
might shortly see the iniquity of their ways, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
return to full loyalty, as behoved true officers of the
Tsar? After all, it was merely a suspicion; all that
talk about big dogs and little dogs might be the purest
nonsense. What right had he to take serious action
upon so feeble a suspicion? Boris finally decided that
he would do nothing rash and ill-considered; for the
generous Tsar would be the first to laugh at him for
jumping at ill-based conclusions, and Boris was very
sensitive to derision, especially at Peter's mouth.</p>

<p>Very soon after the discussion on canine iniquity
recorded above, Boris had the decision as to his duty
in these trying circumstances taken out of his hands
by the workings of destiny. Sitting over his dinner at
the restaurant patronized by the officers of the Streltsi,
he found himself listening in spite of himself to the
conversation of a group of his companions dining at a
table close to his own. The vodka had flowed pretty
freely, it appeared, and tongues were growing looser
and slipping the leash which restraint and discretion
usually put upon them in the presence of Boris.
The major, Platonof, was the noisiest speaker&mdash;he
of the dog story; and Boris several times recognized
his somewhat strident voice raised above that of his
fellows, who, however, generally hushed him down
before his words became distinctly audible. Once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
Boris overheard his own name spoken by one of the
younger officers, whereupon the major said aloud,&mdash;</p>

<p>"What! simple Boris&mdash;our Bear-hunter? Why,
he's a capital fellow is our Boris&mdash;he's one of us&mdash;we
needn't be afraid of Boris.&mdash;Need we, Boris?" he continued,
looking tipsily over his shoulder at the hunter.
"You'll fight for the lord of Russia, won't you,
Boris, in case of need?"</p>

<p>"I'll fight for the Tsar with my last drop of blood,
if that's what you mean," said Boris, flushing.</p>

<p>"Say the Tsar that should be&mdash;the friend of the
church and of the priests&mdash;in fact, the lord of Russia!"
continued Platonof.</p>

<p>"Certainly the lord of Russia," said Boris, "but
why the Tsar that 'should be'?"</p>

<p>"Because," hiccoughed the major solemnly, "while
Peter remains upon the throne, the lord of Russia
reigns only in our hearts. When the Streltsi have
ousted the big dog from the little dog's kennel&mdash;Peter
being the big dog&mdash;and given the little dog back his
bone&mdash;that's Ivan&mdash;then&mdash;"</p>

<p>Platonof never finished that sentence. Boris had
sprung to his feet, and drawing his sword, dashed
from the major's hand the tumbler which he tipsily
waved before his face as he spoke these significant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
words. The vodka which the glass contained bespattered
half the company as they, too, rose excitedly to
their feet.</p>

<p>"Traitors!" cried Boris, "so this is the meaning of
your whisperings and secrecy; and but for yonder
drunken fool I might have remained in ignorance of
your treachery. Out with your swords and defend
yourselves if you are men. I am on Peter's side!"</p>

<p>The party consisted of the major and four others.
All drew their swords, including Platonof, who was
somewhat unsteady, though partly sobered by the
turn events had taken. The rest were pale and
determined, for they realized the fact that the tipsy
major had plunged them into a serious dilemma.
Either they must kill this favourite of the Tsar, and
incur Peter's wrath on that account, or else he must
be allowed to escape alive, but with the certainty
that all he had heard would be repeated for Peter's
private benefit. And then&mdash;well, the young Tsar's
character was already sufficiently understood by his
subjects to leave no doubt in the minds of these
Streltsi officers that he would make a terrible example
of them. Under the circumstances there was
practically no choice for them: it was Boris's life or
theirs; Boris must not leave the room alive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the younger officers sprang to the door and
locked it, placing the key in his pocket. Meanwhile
Boris had crossed swords with Platonof, but finding
that the major was too unsteady to make a fight of
it, he pushed him out of the way. Platonof tumbled
over the table, dragging the glasses and bottles with
him. This was fortunate for Boris, for it placed the
table between himself and his adversaries, and prevented
overcrowding.</p>

<p>Then the four men fiercely attacked the one,
hacking savagely but unscientifically at him, each
retreating as he thrust back. Boris had the advantage
of a long reach, and before many blows had
been exchanged he had put one of his assailants <i>hors
de combat</i> with a straight thrust which penetrated
his sword-arm. Boris knew, as yet, little swordsmanship,
but he had a good natural idea of thrusting
straight and quickly, acquired in his bear-hunting days.
He had, besides, the advantages of great strength and
agility, in both of which qualities he far excelled any
of the five men opposed to him, of whom but three
were now left to carry on the battle. These three
now separated, one presently advancing from either
side, while the third endeavoured to get behind him
in order to take him in the rear. Boris backed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
towards the wall, hoping to frustrate his intention,
while the others pressed him hard in the endeavour
to entice him to follow one of them up. But
Boris, waiting until his third assailant was well
behind him, suddenly swept round with so terrible
a backhander that the unfortunate officer's arm was
cut through and half of his body besides. The
man dropped where he stood and never moved
again.</p>

<p>Then Boris made so savage an attack upon his two
remaining opponents that they fled, and were pursued
by him twice round the room, fighting as they ran,
until Boris, tripping over the sleeping major, fell
among the bottles and glasses. During the moment
or two which expired before the redoubtable bear-hunter
could recover his footing, the two fugitive
heroes succeeded in opening the door and escaping,
but not before Boris, seizing a heavy wooden stool
from the floor, hurled it after them with so true
an aim that it struck the hindmost between the
shoulders, sending him head first downstairs, to the
great injury of his front teeth and the bridge of his
nose.</p>

<p>Then Boris endeavoured to arouse Platonof, to bid
him see to his wounded friends, but found this impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Moreover, he discovered on looking up that
the young officer first wounded had taken the opportunity,
during Boris's preoccupation with the tipsy
major, to escape through the open door. As for the
fifth man, Boris soon found that he would need no
help from the major or any one else. He therefore
administered a final kick to the snoring form of
Platonof, and quitted the apartment which had witnessed
so exciting a struggle for life.</p>

<p>Then only did Boris discover that he had not come
through the fierce fight scathless. His hand was
bleeding from a gash over the knuckles, and a pain
just above the knee, and a rent in his kaftan, plainly
indicated that he had received a second wound more
or less severe. He was able to walk home, however,
to the palace in the Kremlin, and to attend to his
duties about the person of the Tsar. But there the
keen glance of Peter detected at once the cut over
the fingers, and this discovery was instantly followed
by a demand for an explanation.</p>

<p>Boris had firmly resolved that even at the Tsar's
bidding he would never reveal the names of his
assailants, or say more than was absolutely necessary
as to the treasonable words which he had overheard.
When therefore the Tsar inquired what was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
matter with his hand, Boris blushed and stammered,
and said that he had hurt it.</p>

<p>"That much I see already," said Peter. "I see
also that this is a sword cut, and that you have a
rent in your kaftan. You have been fighting, my
Bear-eater, but not with a bear this time, nor yet
with a wolf, except it be a human one. Come, who
is it? Don't be afraid, man&mdash;are we not sworn
brothers?"</p>

<p>"It is true, your Majesty, I have fought," said poor
Boris, and stopped.</p>

<p>"And pray with whom," Peter insisted, "and with
what results? Come, Boris, this is interesting, and
you shall tell me all about it ere we sleep to-night.
I desire it. Have you killed a man? Speak up; I
shall not mind if the cause is good."</p>

<p>"I have killed a man, your Majesty," Boris
stammered, "and the cause is good. The man was
an officer; he is dead, and therefore I may tell
his name&mdash;Zouboff, the Streltsi Captain, of my regiment."</p>

<p>"Oho! Zouboff killed&mdash;and the cause good!" said
the Tsar, looking grave. "And the others of his
company&mdash;Platonof, Katkoff, Zaitzoff, Shurin&mdash;what
of them? Those five are never apart. Fear nothing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
tell me all. I have watched them, and guessed their
disaffection."</p>

<p>Boris was thunderstruck at the Tsar's knowledge,
but he was not startled into committing himself.</p>

<p>"There were others, your Majesty, who took his
part; but I entreat you not to bid me name them,
nor to insist upon the cause of our quarrel. It was
but certain drunken nonsense to which I objected. I
entreat your Majesty to press me no further."</p>

<p>Peter strode up and down the apartment looking
his blackest. For a moment or two it seemed as
though the storm would burst; then his eye fell once
more upon wounded Boris, and his brow cleared.</p>

<p>"And the rest," he asked kindly, "are they wounded
too?"</p>

<p>"Some are wounded; one was too drunk to fight,"
Boris replied, his cheek flushing with martial ardour
as he recalled the circumstances of the late encounter.</p>

<p>"Ho, ho!" laughed the Tsar; "would I had been
there to see, my valiant Bear-eater. Now I will tell
you what happened before the fight, and you shall
narrate to me, without mentioning names, how the
fight itself was conducted; that is a fair compromise.
First, then, one of them&mdash;perhaps Zouboff, who is
dead, or drunken Platonof, who deserves to be&mdash;made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
a remark about one Peter Alexeyevitch Romanof
which our Boris disapproved of&mdash;no matter what he
said. Then up strode Boris. 'Sir,' he said, 'you are
a liar!' or words to that effect, perhaps striking the
speaker with his hand or with the back of his sword.
Then out flew all the swords, five traitor swords
against one honest and loyal one, and then&mdash;well,
then comes your part of the story; so put off that
melancholy expression and speak up. I love to hear
of a good fight."</p>

<p>Boris laughed in spite of himself, for the Tsar's
acuteness delighted him and comforted him also; for,
he reflected, his puny enemies could surely never
triumph over this mighty, all-seeing, all-knowing
young demi-god, his master. Therefore Boris made
no further difficulty about the matter, but did as
Peter bade him, and told the story of his fight in
detail, naming no names.</p>

<p>Peter heard the tale with alternate rage and delight.</p>

<p>"Very good, my Bear-hunter," he said, when the
recital was ended; "excellently good. You have done
well, and for reward I shall take no notice of the
individuals concerned. But for your personal intercession
they should have hung in chains to-morrow
morning from the four corners of their own barracks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
I know their names, though you have not mentioned
them. Now, good-night, Captain Bear-Eater&mdash;you
are captain from to-morrow's date&mdash;and thank you."</p>

<p>Boris threw himself at the Tsar's feet in gratitude
for the magnanimity with which he had consented to
forego his just wrath against these traitors&mdash;he could
have kissed those feet in his joy and in the intensity
of his relief&mdash;for he felt that though he would have
no compunction in slaying these men in fair fight, he
could never have forgiven himself had he as informer
been the means of bringing them to a disgraceful end
upon the gibbet.</p>

<p>"But grant me one more favour, your Majesty," he
pleaded. "I will not ask another until I shall have
earned the right to do so; but grant me this one I
entreat you: send our regiment far away from Moscow;
send it to any distant garrison town, but do not
let it remain here."</p>

<p>"And why not, my Bear-eater?" asked the Tsar,
amused at the earnestness of the appeal.</p>

<p>"Your Majesty knows why not," said Boris; "when
a bough is rotten who would lean upon it?"</p>

<p>"When a bough is rotten," repeated the Tsar, looking
grave, "it is best cut down and burned. But I
will think upon your request&mdash;perhaps you are right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&mdash;though,
my Bear-eater, you too would go with them
in that case, which would be regrettable. Meanwhile
you take care of your own skin, for the Streltsi
officers hold together. Keep that good sword loose
when you approach the dark corners of the city. I
will think of what you have said. Good-night!"</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER X.<br />

A NIGHT AMBUSH.</h2>


<p>Contrary to his expectations, Boris found
that his position in the regiment after the
<i>fracas</i> described in the foregoing chapter was in no
respect more unpleasant than it had been before; indeed,
it appeared to him that his fellow-officers now
treated him with greater consideration. No reference
whatever was made to the death of Zouboff, or indeed
to any circumstance in connection with the fight at
the restaurant. In those days the taking of life was
little thought of, and if an officer chose to brawl
with others of his regiment, and lose his life in the
struggle, that was considered his own look-out, and
so much the worse for him. As for punishing those
at whose hands he met his death, no one thought of
such a thing. Hence matters in the regiment remained
very much as they were before; the officers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
taking care, however, to keep a discreet tongue in the
presence of Boris, and to maintain outwardly an
appearance of respect for that dangerously formidable
young man. As for his late opponents, these glared
at him whenever they met on parade or elsewhere,
and exchanged no word with their late antagonist;
but Boris was not anxious to enter into friendly
intercourse with men whom he had, as he considered,
actually convicted of treason to the Tsar,
and he was glad enough of their coldness towards
him. Platonof, having no recollection of the circumstances
of that fatal afternoon, was not without
a feeling of gratified surprise, when informed of
his indiscretion and its results, that he had been
permitted to depart alive and in peace, and was
inclined to make friendly advances towards the magnanimous
young man who had neither dug him between
the ribs with a sword thrust&mdash;as he undoubtedly
might have done&mdash;nor delivered him alive and
guilty into the hands of an enraged Tsar. But Boris
showed no disposition to respond to his advances,
and treated him with the same disregard which he
showed towards the rest of the party of avowed
traitors to his master.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Tsar had not as yet acceded to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
urgent request of Boris that the regiment might be
sent out of the capital. Peter was unwilling to make
any concession to a feeling of unworthy anxiety for
his personal safety; but, at the same time, he now
only awaited an opportunity to banish the regiment
upon some plausible pretext, for reflection had quite
convinced him that the presence of disaffected Streltsi
in Moscow was a needless standing danger to the
peace of the realm.</p>

<p>The opportunity he sought came in the course of
a few months. It became necessary to send troops
into the south of Russia in preparation for the contemplated
siege of Azof, a fortress of the Mohammedans,
and one of the last still held in the country
by the once all-conquering Mussulman hosts. The
Streltsi of Boris's regiment were ordered to proceed
to the Ukraine, where they were to hold themselves
at the disposal of the Cossack chieftain or hetman
Mazeppa, who had begged of the Tsar some support
in order to enable him to maintain and strengthen
his lately-acquired position at the head of the warlike
tribes he had been called to govern. Peter at all
times showed the most loyal regard for this Mazeppa,
who was destined in after years to ill repay him for
his generosity; and it was in his desire to accede to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the Cossacks request for temporary assistance, and at
the same time to push on his preparations for the
intended Azof campaign, that the Tsar now found an
excellent opportunity for ridding Moscow of a dangerous
element by despatching this disaffected body of
men far away from the seat of government and out
of the reach of any ill-advised interference on their
part.</p>

<p>The order for their departure&mdash;exile, as they
termed it&mdash;was received with a storm of rage and
indignation by all ranks in the regiment. The men
had never before been called upon to leave Moscow
for prolonged service, though many others of the
Streltsi regiments had not been so fortunate. Many
of them were married men with large families, and
were engaged in various profitable trades and professions,
without the exercise of which, they declared,
they would be unable to support those dependent
upon them. Besides this, each man and officer had a
thousand ties and interests which bound him to the
capital, and would bear it ill to have these suddenly
torn away and himself cast adrift into unknown
places and among strange people, and submitted to
dangers and discomforts to which he had not been
trained, and which he feared to encounter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>All sorts of reasons for the Tsar's sudden <i>ookaz</i>,
or edict, were suggested and considered by men and
officers. Had he discovered the disaffection of the
regiment? If so, how? The affair of Boris and
Platonof and his party had not become generally
known, at the urgent request of Platonof, who was
naturally anxious that his tipsy indiscretion should
not be spoken of. Those who were acquainted
with the details of the affair, however, had no
doubt whatever of the cause which had brought the
displeasure of the Tsar upon the regiment: Boris
had revealed the whole story. But in that case
why had the Tsar's vengeance not been&mdash;as the
vengeance of Peter was wont to be&mdash;immediate and
terrible? Why, in other words, were not Platonof
and his three friends dangling aloft far above the
heads of the crowd, upon improvised gibbets, as a
warning to the treasonable and the conspiring?
Probably, these men concluded, because the Tsar was
somewhat afraid of the Streltsi, and was therefore
unwilling to risk giving provocation which might
lead to a sudden rising.</p>

<p>Anyhow, it was not the fault of Boris that worse
things had not happened than this sufficiently annoying
ookaz from the Tsar; and if opportunity arose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
during the three days remaining to the regiment in
Moscow, Boris should be made to regret his position
as spy and tale-bearer-in-ordinary to the Tsar. So
vowed Platonof and his friends, and with them a few
other choice spirits who were acquainted with the
state of affairs, and were not averse to a little night
work at street corners, provided the dangerous element
was eliminated as far as possible!</p>

<p>"Boris, my trusty one, eater of bears and render
of wolves," said the Tsar, on the second evening after
the issue of the ookaz dismissing the Streltsi from
Moscow, "I feel inclined for an evening out. What
say you to a visit to Lefort and a taste of his French
wine, and perhaps a game or two at cards, to-night?
If Lefort is asleep, so much the better; we'll pull him
out of bed, and bid him send for Gordon and the
rest, and we can order supper while he's dressing."</p>

<p>Lefort, one of Peter's prime favourites, as he well
deserved to be when his services to Russia and the
Tsar are taken into consideration, was the third of
the trio selected by the monarch as his constant companions
and advisers, the remaining members of
this trinity of favour being Menshikoff and Patrick
Gordon, once a Scotsman, and related to some of the
best and oldest Scottish families, now a naturalized<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
Russian and the ablest of Peter's generals, as well as
his most faithful and honoured servant. Menshikoff
had not as yet come into prominence; but Gordon
and Lefort&mdash;the latter a Russianized foreigner as
Gordon was&mdash;were already the chosen advisers and
friends of the Tsar, both men after his own heart&mdash;capable,
brave, hard workers, ready at an instant's
notice either to drink and fool with their master, to
command his armies or direct his fleets, to wrestle
with him and engage in any kind of athletic competition,
to build boats with him, to make love with
him, or, in a word, share with the Tsar in any and
every occupation or duty which Peter might call upon
them to perform.</p>

<p>It was no uncommon event for the young monarch
to suddenly descend thus upon his friends at any
hour of the day or night, and General (Patrick) Gordon
has left it on record that occasionally these visits were
made at the dinner-hour, upon short notice, and sometimes
with a retinue of a hundred companions. Thus
it was necessary for the friends of the Tsar to keep
in the house a constant stock of wine for the consumption
of Peter and his following, which might
consist of one or two persons, or, as I have said, of a
hundred men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>"We will go incognito," Peter added. "Muffle
yourself in this cloak, and I will do the same; it is
better not to be seen. I love to go among my people
in the streets and hear what they say about me."</p>

<p>Nothing loath, Boris took the Tsar's spare cloak,
which was much too big for him in spite of his
seventy odd inches of bone and muscle, and followed
his master from the Kremlin. Through the streets
of the old city went the tall pair, pausing here and
there in the darker corners in order to listen to the
conversation of the townsfolk as they passed. This
was a favourite pastime of Peter's, who loved to
gather at first-hand the opinions and wishes of his
poorer subjects, with whom he was ever the popular
hero as well as the beloved sovereign, and from whose
lips there was therefore little risk of hearing anything
about himself which would sound unpleasant in
his ears. On this occasion he heard little of interest.
A few remarks were made about the impending departure
of the Streltsi, which the people appeared to
regret but little. Presently, however, two young
Streltsi officers came walking down the street talking
confidentially. Peter and Boris withdrew deeper into
the shadow and listened.</p>

<p>"Consequently," said one, "there's no doubt whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
about it&mdash;we have to thank him and him only
for the ookaz."</p>

<p>"What! do you suppose he told the Tsar about
what that fool Platonof said, and all that?" said the
second officer, who apparently had just been informed
by his companion of the encounter between Boris and
his assailants.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly he did, confound him!" said the
first; "and that's why we are all off the day after
to-morrow."</p>

<p>"Well, why don't we get hold of the spying rascal
and"&mdash;the officer made a gesture as of a knife at his
throat. The other laughed.</p>

<p>"That's just what's going on now, I hope," he said;
"for Zaitzoff and a few others have sworn to have
him before we go. They watched all last night; and
to-night they are keeping guard at the corner of the
Uspensky, where he goes for his supper. I hope they
kill him&mdash;hateful spy!"</p>

<p>Peter almost danced with delight as the footsteps
of the men died away in the distance. "Bear-eater,
my son, we are in luck!" he whispered excitedly.
"Come along quickly. Got your sword?"</p>

<p>Boris rattled his weapon for answer, but he looked
grave and preoccupied. "Go home, your Majesty, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
entreat you," he said; "don't run into needless danger.
I can settle accounts with these men alone."</p>

<p>For a moment the Tsar looked as black as thunder.
"<i>What!</i>" he cried; "go home, and miss the play?
Don't be a fool, man. Am I to be afraid of my own
officers? No, my Bear-eater. You may cut and run
from an old bear if you like, but not I from a Streletz,
or any number of Streltsi. Come on!" The Tsar
ended with one of his loud laughs, and dragged after
him poor Boris, whose cheek was red by reason of
Peter's allusion to his escapade with the bear.</p>

<p>Through the wretchedly lighted streets they sped
until they reached the Uspensky, where, in the distance,
they soon espied a group of figures standing at
the corner as though awaiting an arrival.</p>

<p>The two tall men, shrouded in their mantles as
they were, approached close up to the group of
officers before they were recognized.</p>

<p>"It's the Tsar!" some one whispered at length.
"Round the corner all, and away&mdash;quick!"</p>

<p>Off went the party, scudding down the road like
a pack of frightened sheep; but the Tsar's loud voice
of authority soon recalled them. They crept back in
a huddled, scared group.</p>

<p>"Good evening, Zaitzoff," said Peter. "How are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
you, Shurin? What, Ulanof, is that you? Good
evening, gentlemen all. You are waiting for the
pleasure of seeing my friend Boris Ivanitch, I believe.
Well, here he is."</p>

<p>No one spoke a word. The Tsar laughed. "Is
it not so? Zaitzoff, speak!"</p>

<p>"It is true, your Majesty," said Zaitzoff at length.
"We came to meet the gentleman you name, with
whom we have a quarrel."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed!" said the Tsar, in affected surprise;
"what, all of you? Do you <i>all</i> desire to quarrel
with my friend? It is most flattering, upon my word,
gentlemen. And do you still wish to quarrel with
Boris Ivanitch, now he is here? Positively I was
under the impression that I observed you all racing
down the road there, as though anxious to get out of
his way!"</p>

<p>"Our quarrel is a private one, your Majesty," said
Ulanof; "and if your Majesty will withdraw, we shall
proceed with it."</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;withdraw? I, his second? No, my
good Ulanof, that is impossible; the quarrel must
proceed. Boris Ivanitch is here to give you every
satisfaction, and I shall act as his second. Now then,
gentlemen, who is to lay on first? One would suppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
that you had contemplated a combined assault in the&mdash;ha!
ha!&mdash;in the dark, were we not acquainted with
the strictly honourable traditions of the Streltsi officers.
Come, Zaitzoff, you seem to be the leader of the party;
you shall have the first opportunity of depriving the
rest of their prey.&mdash;Come, Boris, draw!"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />

A BATTLE AGAINST ODDS.</h2>


<p>The experience of two months ago, when he had
last been called upon to defend his life against
some of these very men, had not been lost upon Boris.
He had then realized that he was but a poor swordsman,
and that he was indebted more to his superior
agility and strength than to his skill for his safety
on that occasion. True, his antagonists had shown
that their knowledge of the science was not greater
than his own; but nevertheless Boris had made a
mental note of his incapacity, and had registered at
the same time a vow to make the science of the sword
his principal study until he should have gained at
least a fair degree of proficiency. He had not failed
to put this good resolution into practice, and had
assiduously worked at his fencing daily with an exponent
of the art, a German named Schmidt, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
whose skilful tuition, and with his natural aptitude
for every kind of manly exercise, Boris had quickly
acquired no little skill in the use of his somewhat
clumsy but formidable Russian weapon.</p>

<p>At the first onset, the Tsar was surprised and
delighted to observe that Boris was more than a
match for his opponent. Before the swords had been
crossed for two minutes, Zaitzoff was disabled and
disarmed.</p>

<p>The Tsar bade him give up his sword and retire
to the opposite wall, where he might watch the fun
with as much comfort as was possible with a hole
through his sword-arm and a deepish cut in the
shoulder as well. Then Ulanof came to take his
place.</p>

<p>Ulanof was a big and heavy man, determined and
very powerful, but lacking skill. He made so furious
an onslaught upon his antagonist, cutting and slashing
and thrusting at him with extreme rapidity though
quite without method, that for some moments Boris
was fully occupied in defending his own person without
attempting to carry the fight into the enemy's
camp&mdash;in fact he actually lost ground, being surprised
into stepping backwards by the unexpectedly furious
character of Ulanof's attack upon him. But as soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
as the Tsar whispered encouragingly, "Steady, my
Bear-eater!" Boris quickly recovered his position, and
pulling himself together delivered an equally furious
but a more scientific counter-attack upon Ulanof,
whose exertions had already deprived him of much
breath.</p>

<p>Still fiercely battling, and contesting every inch of
ground, Ulanof was now driven backwards yard by
yard until he stood at bay with his back to the wall
of the house opposite. To that wall Boris speedily
spitted him, his sword passing through Ulanof's body
and into the wooden side of the house, whence
Boris with difficulty drew it forth. As he did so,
Ulanof fell with a gasp at his feet, and the officers'
list of the Streltsi regiment was shorter by one
name.</p>

<p>"Bravo, bravo, my good Boris!" cried the Tsar;
"it was well and scientifically done, and after the
German method, I perceive. We shall see you sticking
bears in the Prussian fashion on our next trip.&mdash;Now,
gentlemen, how many more of you? Four, is
it not?&mdash;Now, what say you, Boris, to taking them
two at a time? This single process grows tedious.
I shall see fair play&mdash;is it agreed?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart, your Majesty, if you desire it,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
said Boris, eying his still untried foes as though to
estimate his chances against them, two swords to
one.</p>

<p>After a short whispered consultation, these officers,
however, stepped forward and informed the Tsar that
their honour was satisfied&mdash;there was no need for the
fight to continue.</p>

<p>But the Tsar would not hear of it. The matter
rested with Boris Ivanitch, he declared; and, if Boris
so desired it, every one of them should meet him until
<i>his</i> honour had obtained ample satisfaction. "As for
<i>your</i> honour, gentlemen, you left it at home when
you sallied forth this evening like common midnight
assassins to fall upon him unawares and murder him.
No, officers of the Streltsi, you are here to fight, and
fight you shall. If any man shirks, I too have a
sword, and with my sword I shall write 'coward'
on his body for all men to see!"</p>

<p>Then the two, Katkoff and Shurin, fell upon the
one, and the fight recommenced; and a good fight it
was. Katkoff was a good swordsman, Shurin was
strong and active, and the battle was at first sight
unequal. The Tsar would not suffer the pair to separate.
If either attempted to edge to one side and
take Boris in the flank, the Tsar angrily bade him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
return to line. The battle was to be fought fair, this
much was plainly evident; it behoved Shurin and his
partner, therefore, to be careful and watch, and to
take the first advantage that offered.</p>

<p>Boris fought like a lion, or like one of his own
bears at bay. In vain Katkoff slashed and Shurin
thrust; his sword was always there to intercept, and
even to aim an answering blow before the pair were
able to repeat the attack. Once a thrust from Shurin
touched his cheek and made the blood spirt. Shurin
cheered, and redoubled his exertions, well backed up
by Katkoff. Then Boris, like an enraged tiger, fell
upon the pair so fiercely, raining his blows upon
them like hailstones in June, that they gave ground
both together. Pursuing his advantage quickly Boris
drove them round by the wall, the two whole men
and the wounded one moving out of their way as
they went, Peter close at their heels to see fair play.
One tripped over dead Ulanof and nearly fell, but
recovered himself and fought on. Then Boris in his
turn tripped and fell on his knee. In an instant the
two were upon him, and Shurin's thrust pierced
through his left arm, while he just saved his head
from the downward blow of Katkoff's weapon. But
before Shurin could withdraw his sword, Boris aimed
a cut at the arm that held it with such terrible force
that it was severed at the wrist. Shurin caught at
the kaftan of Boris to pull him over; while Katkoff,
seeing that now, if ever, he must make his effort and
end this struggle, rained his blows from above. Then
Boris, in guarding his shoulder, nevertheless contrived
at the same time to administer to Shurin a backhander
which laid him flat beside Ulanof, and rising from
his kneeling position he so furiously fell upon
Katkoff that in a moment the latter was disarmed,
his sword flying through the air with a whistle, and
alighting point-down upon the low wooden roof of an
adjoining house, where it stuck, vibrating with the
force of its flight.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 582px;">

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>But this was Boris's final effort&mdash;tired nature
could do no more. He turned, as though to return
to Peter's side, but slipped and fell fainting into the
Tsar's strong embrace.</p>

<p>Peter looked darkly around at the remains of the
party which had been so roughly handled by Boris.
"Go!" he said, "get you gone, you that can walk.
Leave your swords. You shall hear of me to-morrow.
Meanwhile, you that have escaped, be thankful that
I am not tempted myself to finish what Boris Ivanitch
has left undone. I should know well how to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
treat midnight assassins. Leave your swords, I say.
Now go!"</p>

<p>As the party of discomfited warriors limped and
slunk away in the darkness, leaving Shurin and
Ulanof behind them, the Tsar tenderly picked up
the still unconscious Boris in his great arms, and
carried him like a child to the nearest house. Thither
he sent his own doctor, a Scotsman of much skill,
under whose care Boris very quickly came round,
and, his arm being carefully bandaged and treated,
he was able to return on foot to the palace, to the
delight of his master.</p>

<p>But though Boris was able to make his own way
home, he was not destined to come through this
matter quite so easily as he had at first believed.
His wound proved somewhat obstinate, and the poor
hunter tossed for many days upon his plain camp-bed,
racked with pain and fever, during which time he
longed incessantly for the fresh air, and the forest,
and the delights of his old open-air life. All that
could be done to relieve his pain and hasten his
recovery was done by Macintyre, the Tsar's own
doctor, who tended him assiduously, having taken
a great liking to this fine specimen of a Russian
peasant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The Tsar himself frequently stole an hour from his
various pressing duties in order to sit by his favourite
servant and chat over what had been and what was
yet to be&mdash;fighting over again their battles with bear
and wolf, which, to the joy of Boris, Peter solemnly
promised should be repeated at the earliest opportunity;
and discussing many projects at that time in
the brain of the Tsar&mdash;such as the development of
a standing army, which idea was already beginning to
take practical form; the organization of a navy; the
building of a capital which should be a seaport; the
necessity for recommencing that which Ivan the Terrible
had so nearly accomplished, but in which that
monarch had eventually failed&mdash;namely, the wresting
from their lieges of those ports in the Baltic which
were absolutely necessary for the development of the
empire; and, lastly, Eastern conquest&mdash;overland trade
with India, and many other dazzling projects upon
which the heart of Peter was set.</p>

<p>From the Tsar, also, Boris learned that the banishment
of the Streltsi regiment to which the wounded
hunter was attached was now an accomplished fact.
After the disgraceful conduct of the officers at the
corner of the Uspensky, Peter had determined that
the regiment should not remain another hour in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
capital, but be marched out of it as early as possible
on the following morning. The Tsar therefore himself
attended the early parade of the regiment, when
he read aloud a revised list of officers, in which the
names of the six midnight assailants of Boris had
no place. In their stead were substituted those of
six privates, men who had shown aptitude for military
service, and whose good conduct had entitled them
to recognition. Then Peter read the names of six
officers who, he said, in consequence of conduct which
disqualified them for ever from associating with men
of their own position in the service, were degraded to
the ranks. These men were directed to step out in
order to be deprived of their insignia of officer's
rank, when Peter himself tore from their shoulders
the epaulets of their order. It was observed that
but four men appeared instead of six, and that one of
these wore his arm in a sling, while another limped
as he walked.</p>

<p>After this ceremony, the Tsar bade the commanding
officer pass the regiment in review, when Peter
himself uttered several words of command; finally in
stentorian tones giving the order,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Gentlemen of the Streltsi, form in marching order!
Right about face! Quick march! to the Ukraine!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>As the Tsar uttered these words, the consternation
and surprise of the regiment, men and officers, was
indescribable. None had expected this sudden change
of date; no one was ready; final arrangements for
the winding up or transfer of business had been
left by many to the last moment, and were still in
abeyance; farewells to families and lovers were still
unsaid; many of the men were but half dressed,
their long kaftans serving to conceal the shortcomings
of the unseen portion of their costume. But none
dared disobey the personal ookaz of the masterful
young giant whose stern lips had uttered it.</p>

<p>Sobbing and whining the regiment marched slowly
through the streets of Moscow, followed by troops of
women and children, who sobbed and whined also.
The officers strode along looking pale and gloomy,
many with tears streaming down their faces. The
word had soon passed from street to street, and
from house to house, and as the woful procession
approached the gates of the city the ranks of the
weeping crowd of friends and relatives became largely
increased, until, when the regiment had reached the
open country, the colonel, who doubtless had matters
of his own to attend to, called a halt in order that
the unfortunate men might at least take a last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
farewell of their wives and families ere they marched
out into an exile the duration of which none could
foretell.</p>

<p>Then ensued a remarkable scene. Most of the
men were married, and most of the wives and a great
host of children of all ages had heard the news
of the sudden departure of their lords, and had
hastened after them to get a last glimpse of them,
and if possible a last word. No sooner had the
ranks obeyed the order to halt, than the lines were
instantly invaded by swarms of sobbing women
and children, each seeking her own, and calling
his name aloud. The confusion became indescribable,
the din deafening. Frantic women, unable to
find their husbands or lovers, rushed shrieking from
line to line, imploring sergeants and soldiers to tell
them where to seek their lords. Others, having
found their belongings, clung about their necks, while
the children clasped the knees of their fathers and
cried aloud. For a full hour the scene of woe and
noise was prolonged, and then at last the word
was given to resume the march, the women and
children being forbidden to follow further. Many
young wives and girls, however, refused to obey the
colonel's command, and followed or accompanied the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
troops for many miles, wailing and crying and shouting
last words of love and farewell to their friends in the
ranks.</p>

<p>Thus did Peter rid himself, in a characteristic
manner, of a regiment which he knew to be rotten
at the core. And thus it happened that Boris remained
behind while the rest went into exile.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />

A PERILOUS SLIDE.</h2>


<p>To Boris the news that the Streltsi had gone
away without him was the best and most
acceptable news in the world. To his simple, honest
mind the atmosphere of disloyalty and disaffection
in which he had been forced to live, as well as the
unrest and actual physical danger which were the unavoidable
consequence of the unpopularity in which
he was held by his fellows, as one outside their own
circle and therefore dangerous&mdash;all this was intolerable.
Boris was not a quarrelsome man, yet he had
been forced into several fights already; and if he had
proceeded to the Ukraine with the rest he would undoubtedly
have been drawn into many other quarrels
as soon as the repressive influence of the Tsar's presence
had ceased to work upon the minds of his
comrades. The departure of the Streltsi, therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
acted like a tonic upon his system, and his recovery
was speedy from this day onwards. Within a week
after the scene on the parade-ground Boris was up
and about attending once more upon his master, the
Tsar, and learning with astonishment the remarkable
phases and contrasts of Peter's character&mdash;a character
which must ever puzzle students and analysts in the
inconsistencies and contradictions which it revealed
from day to day.</p>

<p>Peter was particularly busy just at this time enrolling
soldiers for certain new regiments of Guards
which he designed should take the place of the erratic
Streltsi. Lefort, of whom mention has already been
made, was most energetic in this work, and proved
himself a most successful recruiting officer. Foreigners&mdash;Englishmen,
Germans, and others&mdash;were engaged
as far as possible to officer these new troops;
but Boris, to his great joy, was permitted to exchange
from his Streltsi regiment, which he hated, into one
of the newly-organized corps.</p>

<p>The Tsar was radiant and happy over the congenial
work upon which he was engaged, and worked night
and day in order to accomplish the task he had set
before himself. Yet, in spite of his activity and
energy, and of the amazing amount of work he managed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
to get through during the day, this remarkable
young monarch found time for boisterous carousals
almost every evening. At these Boris was expected
to attend the Tsar, and did so; but he was never a
lover of indoor amusements, and did not take to card-playing
and heavy drinking with the zeal infused into
the pursuit of such joys by his betters, including Peter
himself.</p>

<p>At the court, too, Boris was out of his element.
The big bear-hunter was not used to the society of
ladies; and though the manners of Peter's court were
far from being characterized by all that we in our day
understand when we speak of refinement and breeding,
yet the measure of their civilization was naturally far
beyond that reached by the good folks at Dubinka,
or even at Archangel.</p>

<p>The ladies of the court, including the empress,
were one and all attracted by the handsome young
hunter, now officer, and some made no secret of their
admiration. The empress was kind and condescending,
and occasionally preached Boris a little sermon
on the iniquity of making friends of foreigners, warning
him to beware of familiarity with those alien
officers who had lately been imported into Russia.
These men, the Tsaritsa declared, would be the ruin&mdash;they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
and the foreign institutions and vices which
they foreshadowed&mdash;of holy Russia and her exclusiveness.
The church, she said, and all her
dignitaries looked with horror upon the many un-Russian
innovations which were the ruling spirit of
the day.</p>

<p>Boris thought that the empress ought to know all
about the church and her opinions, if anybody did,
for the palace, or her own portion of it, was always
full of priests and confessors; but he thought it a
curious circumstance, nevertheless, that the wife should
speak thus of the work upon which the husband was
engaged. To his frank and simple mind it appeared
unnatural and wrong that the very person in all the
world who should have been the first to encourage
and help the Tsar in his work of reformation and
progress should have neglected no opportunity of
hindering and crying it down.</p>

<p>In short, the ladies of the court had for Boris but
little attraction; he had not been used to the society
of ladies, and did not understand them and their mysterious
ways. He was glad when Peter avoided his
wife's portion of the palace for days together; and
though he did not particularly enjoy the carouses with
Lefort and Gordon, and other kindred spirits of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
Tsar, yet he preferred these noisy and rowdy gatherings
to the society of the ladies. In a word, Boris
was not a lady's man, although there were many fair
damsels at court and out of it who would fain it had
been otherwise.</p>

<p>But Boris had a little adventure early in this first
winter in Moscow which laid the foundation of a
great and momentous friendship, the greatest and
most important of any formed by him throughout
his life, even though we include that which united
him with his beloved Tsar. The circumstances were
romantic, and may be given with propriety in this
place.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned that many foreigners were
at this time being attracted into Russia by the liberal
offers made to them of lucrative employment in the
service of the Tsar. Among the officers thus engaged
by Peter to train and command his newly-levied
troops of the Guard was a certain Englishman of the
name of Drury, who, with his wife and little daughter
aged twelve, had but lately arrived in the great
northern city. Boris had seen and made the acquaintance
of the English officer at Peter's palace, and had
moreover met the wife and child at the court of the
Tsaritsa, where he had admired the little, bright-eyed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
flaxen-haired English maiden, and had even played
ball with her, and taught her the use of the Russian
swing in the courtyard.</p>

<p>Nancy Drury, as she was called, possessed all the
love for outdoor amusements and exercise which is
the heritage of the British race; and, consequently,
no sooner did the early northern winter bring enough
frost to cover the narrow Moscow river with a thin
layer of ice, than Miss Nancy determined to make the
most of the advantages of living "up north," by enjoying
an hour's sliding at the very first opportunity.
Thus, on the second day after the appearance of the
ice, though no Russian would have thought of stepping
upon it for at least another week, the child walked
fearlessly out to the centre of the stream and commenced
her sliding.</p>

<p>The ice was smooth and very elastic, and Nancy
found the sliding excellent; but, as might have been
expected, at the third or fourth slide the ice gave
way beneath even her light feet, and in went Nancy,
sprawling forwards as her footing played her false,
and thus breaking up a large hole for herself to
splash into. Luckily Nancy was a brave child, and
did not struggle and choke and go straight to the
bottom, or under the ice. She supported herself as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
best she could upon the sound ice which surrounded
the hole she had made, and shouted for assistance.</p>

<p>The streets were full of people; but that circumstance
was of little comfort to poor Nancy, had she
known it. For if she had found herself in this fix
on ninety-nine out of a hundred occasions, she would
have received no doubt the deepest sympathy from
those on shore, evidenced by much weeping and wailing
from the women, and running about and shouting
of conflicting instructions and advice on the part of
the men; but as for solid assistance, she would have
gone to the bottom long before the one man in a hundred
or a thousand who could render it to her had
arrived upon the scene. Luckily again for Nancy,
however, that one man chanced to pass by on this
occasion, in the shape of our brave bear-hunter, and
in the very nick of time.</p>

<p>Boris grasped the situation at a glance, though
without as yet recognizing the child. Kicking off his
heavy Russian boots, he ran nimbly over the intervening
ice, which lay in broken, floating pieces behind
him as he crushed it beneath his feet at each quick
step, and reached the child in a twinkling, seizing her
in his arms and floating with her for a moment as he
reflected upon the best way to get back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>During that moment Nancy recognized her preserver
and clung to him, shivering and crying a little, but
with an assurance of safety in his strong arms which
she did her best to express by burying her face in his
breast and half drowning him with her clinging arms
about his neck.</p>

<p>A wonderfully tender spirit fell over the rough
hunter as he felt the confiding hugs of this little
English girl, and he realized that she must be saved
at all hazards. But it was exceedingly difficult to
swim with her in his arms, as those who have tried
it will know, especially as his course was impeded
by floating ice of sufficient strength and thickness to
offer an awkward obstacle to a burdened swimmer.
Boris was aware that little Nancy had picked up but
little Russian as yet; nevertheless he succeeded in
conveying to her that she must not clasp his neck so
tightly, or both would presently go to the bottom;
also that he intended to help her to climb back upon
the ice, but that he would be near if it should break
again and let her through. Then, finding a sound
edge which looked strong enough for his purpose,
with an effort he raised the child sufficiently high to
slide her out upon unbroken ice, where Nancy quickly
regained her feet and ran lightly to the shore. As for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Boris, relieved of his burden, he easily swam to shore,
where he found his little friend awaiting him.</p>

<p>To the immense amusement of the onlookers, of
whom there was a considerable gathering, Nancy,
having first with her little hand helped him out of
the water, sprang up into the arms of her big preserver
and covered his wet face with kisses. Then
the tall hunter and his little English friend walked
off together, amid the admiring comments of the
crowd, who were unanimous in their opinion that the
officer was a <i>molodyets</i>, or, as a British schoolboy
would call it, "a rare good chap;" and that the little
<i>Anglichanka</i> was very sweet to look upon, and wore
very nice clothes.</p>

<p>From this day commenced a firm friendship between
these two persons, which strengthened and ripened
from week to week and from month to month. They
were in some respects an oddly-assorted couple; and
yet there was much in common between them, as for
instance the intense love which both bore towards the
open air and all that appertains to life in the country.
Nancy had lived, while still in her English home, far
away from the town; her sympathies were all for the
fields, the woods, birds, and rabbits, and wild fowl,
and the sights and sounds of the country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>Neither Drury nor his wife had the slightest objection
to the great friendship existing between their
little daughter and this fine young officer of the Tsar;
as indeed why should they? On the contrary, they
were glad enough to intrust her to one who could be
so thoroughly trusted to take good care of her under
any and every circumstance and emergency which
could arise, whether in the forest or in the streets of
the city. Consequently the two were often together;
and Boris loved nothing better than to set his little
friend in a <i>kibitka</i>, or covered sledge drawn by two
horses, and drive out with her into the country, far
away beyond the smoke and din of Moscow.</p>

<p>There he would spend a few happy hours in teaching
the child the art of tracking and trapping hares,
foxes, and larger game, an art in which Nancy proved
an apt pupil; while his skill in calling birds and
beasts to him proved a source of unfailing delight
and amusement to her. Concealed in a tiny conical
hut made of fir boughs, and built to represent as far
as possible a snow-laden pine tree, the pair would sit
for an hour or two and watch the effects of Boris's
skilful imitation of the various voices of the forest.
Many a time did Nancy enjoy the excitement of hearing
and even occasionally of seeing a wolf, as he came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
inquisitively peering and listening close up to the hut,
wondering where in the world his talkative friend had
hidden himself, and evidently half beginning to fear
that he had been the victim of a hoax. On such
occasions a loud report from Boris's old-fashioned
matchlock quickly assured the poor wolf that he had
indeed been deluded to his destruction, and that this
hoax was the very last he should live to be the
victim of.</p>

<p>Rare, indeed, was the day when the hunter and his
little English friend returned to Moscow without
something to show as the result of their drive out
into the forest. Whether it was a hare, or a brace of
tree-partridges, or the pretty red overcoat of a fox,
or the gray hide of a wolf&mdash;something was sure to
accompany little Nancy when she returned to her
father's apartments; for Boris was a hunter whose
skill never failed.</p>

<p>Thus the winter passed and the summer came, and
another winter, and the Tsar was ever busy with his
recruiting, and his drilling, and his revellings, and his
designing of ships and fleets. And Boris was busy
also with his duty and his pleasure&mdash;his duty with
his regiment and with his Tsar, and his chief pleasure
in the company of the little English girl who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
had found for herself a place so close to his heart.
And Boris was happy both in his pleasure and in his
duties, as should be the case with every right-minded
person, and is, I trust, with every reader of these
lines.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />

BORIS GOES ON THE WAR-PATH.</h2>


<p>One day the Tsar asked Boris whether he would
like to be one of the electors of the College
of Bacchus, and take part in the election of a new
president.</p>

<p>The College of Bacchus was one of the products of
those all too frequent uproarious moods of the Tsar,
when he and his friends would meet to drink and
make a noise, to gamble, wrestle, play with the <i>kegels</i>,
or skittles, and, in short, pass a day or a night in
those festivities which Peter found necessary in order
to work off some of the superabundant energy with
which nature had dowered him. The college was, as
its name implies, a mere drinking institution, wherein
the hardest drinker was king, or pope, or president;
and the last president of this society having lately
died, it became necessary to elect a successor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>When the Tsar proposed to Boris, however, that the
latter should form one of the electors, he doubtless
offered the suggestion more by way of banter than
in sober seriousness; for none knew better than Peter
that such a thing as an election at the College of
Bacchus was not at all in Boris's line. It is distinctly
to the credit of the many-sided Tsar that he thought
none the worse of his faithful hunter because the
latter had not proved so good a boon companion as
others of his favourites of the day. He was fully
conscious of Boris's many excellent qualities, and
easily forgave him his shortcomings as a reveller in
consideration of his humble birth and upbringing,
as well as of his pre-eminence in other directions.
Hence when Peter made the suggestion, he was not
offended, but only amused, when Boris said, with a
grimace, that he thought his Majesty must probably
possess many subjects better qualified than a poor
bear-hunter for so exalted an office. Peter, with a
laugh, agreed that this might be so; but added that
he was not so certain that he could find any one
better qualified than Boris to act as judge or referee
at the election, since it would be the duty of that
functionary to keep the peace and to restrain the
ardour, if necessary, of the electors, who would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
likely to prove an awkward body to manage, and
would require both a strong hand and a cool head to
keep in order during the excitement of the election.</p>

<p>Since Peter appeared anxious that Boris should act
in the capacity last suggested&mdash;that of referee&mdash;the
hunter did not refuse to comply with his request.
The experience was of service to him because it gave
him once for all so great a horror of the vice of
drinking that he never afterwards, to his dying day,
took spirits of any kind excepting on special occasions
when he considered the stuff to be required medicinally,
and then in small quantities.</p>

<p>It was no wonder that a sober-minded man like
Boris should have refused to act as one of the electors,
as my readers will agree when I explain the function
in use at the elections of the College of Bacchus.
The body of twelve electors were locked up together
in a room which contained a large table in the centre
of which was a wine cask, upon which one of them
sat astride, representing Bacchus. On either side of
this emblematical figure were a stuffed bear and a live
monkey.</p>

<p>The hour at which those chosen to elect the new
president were locked up was about seven in the
evening, from which time until the following morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
when the door was thrown open once more, each
elector was obliged to swallow at regular intervals a
large glassful of vodka, a spirit nearly, though not
quite, so strong as whisky. He whose head proved
best able to support this trying ordeal was the chosen
president for the following year, or series of years.</p>

<p>The function to which Boris had been called was
to see that each elector was supplied with his proper
allowance of vodka at the stipulated times, and to
prevent any quarrelling between them. The hunter
found that the office of judge and peacemaker was no
sinecure, and a thousand times during the night did
poor Boris bitterly repent his compliance with the
Tsar's wishes in this matter, and long for the arrival
of morning to put an end to the scene of which he
was a thoroughly disgusted and sickened spectator.</p>

<p>This was one of the peculiar ways in which the
greatest and by far the ablest and most enlightened
monarch that Russia had ever seen amused himself,
the sovereign but for whom Russia would have lagged
hundreds of years behind in the race of civilization
and progress, but for whose foresight and sagacity,
too, Russia might never have occupied the position
she now holds in the councils of Europe and of the
world. This was Peter at his lowest and meanest;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
and if we shall see him in these pages at his cruelest
and most brutal, we shall also have the opportunity, I
trust, of viewing this many-sided and truly remarkable
man at his highest and noblest&mdash;and none was
ever nobler and more self-sacrificing and devoted than
he when occasion arose for the display of his best
qualities, for the truth of which statement let the
manner of his death testify.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the Tsar himself took
part in the degrading ceremony I have just described.
Beyond locking and sealing the door upon the electors,
and again unlocking it at morning, Peter took no
personal part in the proceedings, thus exercising a
wise discretion.</p>

<p>Boris came forth from that room feeling that he
could never again attend the Tsar at one of his
drinking bouts at Lefort's or at Gordon's, or elsewhere;
he had seen enough drinking and drunkenness
to make him hate the very sight of a vodka bottle.
When he told Peter of this, and of his intense desire
to be exempted from the duty of attending any further
carousals, the Tsar slapped him on the back and laughed
in his loud way.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>
<p>"I am glad, my Bear-eater," he said, "that I have
at least one friend who is not afraid of being great
when I am little! There are plenty left to drink
with me. You shall be a total abstainer, and then I
am sure of some one to steady me when I return at
nights less master of myself than of Russia. I am
glad of your decision, my good Boris; you shall be as
sober as you please, so long as I need not follow your
example." With that Peter laughed again, louder
than ever, and gave Boris a great push by the shoulders,
which sent him flying backwards against the
wall, and proved conclusively that whatever the Tsar
might be "when he returned late at night," he was
master of himself, at all events, at this particular
moment.</p>

<p>Thus it came about that Boris gradually became
practically a teetotaller&mdash;which is a <i>rara avis</i> in
Russia, and was still more so in those old days when
drunkenness was thought little of, and was even
habitually indulged in by the honoured head of the
realm.</p>

<p>Boris had many friends now, chiefly among the
officers of his regiment, with whom, in spite of his
humble origin, he was extremely popular. By this
time he excelled in all those arts which were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
peculiar property of the military&mdash;in swordsmanship,
in drill, and even in gunnery, upon the practice of
which the Tsar laid great stress. Competitions were
held among the officers; and here Boris soon displayed
a marked superiority over his fellows, his accurate
eye and steady hand enabling him to do far better
work with the big clumsy ordnance than his fellows,
many of whom could rarely boast of a steady hand at
any time of day. It was a peculiarity of the Tsar
himself, however, who indeed was an exception to all
rules, that however deep his potations might have
been, either on the previous evening or on the very
day of the competition, his hand was always steady
and his eye true&mdash;in fact, he was at all times the
chief rival of Boris for first gunnery honours.</p>

<p>Such was the life in Moscow during the two or
three years which our friend passed in the capital at
this stage of his career&mdash;years which were of incalculable
benefit to him as a period of education and
experience; years also which were passed very happily,
and during which the friendship between the young
guardsman and Nancy Drury ever ripened and
matured. From Nancy, Boris gradually picked up
more than a smattering of the English language, and
by the time he had known her for two full years the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
pair were able to converse in English&mdash;a circumstance
greatly applauded by Peter, who meditated a visit to
our country, and declared that the hunter should go
with him and do the talking for him.</p>

<p>But before the plans for a trip to England and the
Continent had taken definite shape, events occurred
to postpone the journey for a while. The regiment
of Guards to which Boris was attached was ordered
to proceed to the south of Russia, where the Streltsi
were already gathered before the walls of the city
of Azof in preparation for a siege. Boris took an
affectionate farewell of his beloved master, who bade
him God-speed and a quick return home. "Don't get
into trouble with your old enemies of the Streltsi,"
were the Tsar's parting words. "See if you can be
the first man into Azof&mdash;I expect it of you&mdash;and be
home as quickly as possible; for what am I to do
without my faithful old Sobersides Bear-eater to keep
me in order and take care of me?"</p>

<p>Boris laughed at the allusion to his old acquaintances
the Streltsi; he had quite grown out of his
dislike and horror for those poor misguided men, and
was inclined to recall their treatment of him with
indulgence and pity rather than with indignation.
"I am sure to be back soon, your Majesty," he said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
"if the Tartars don't pick me off. We'll soon pepper
them out of Azof. And, besides, I have attractions
here besides your Majesty's person."</p>

<p>"Ah, the fair Nancy! I had forgotten," said Peter,
laughing. "Well, well, my Bear-eater, happy is he
who is beloved by a child; their love is better than
woman's love, and wears better, too. Now go and
bid farewell to your Nancy. Tell her Peter will look
after her right well in your absence!"</p>

<p>Boris went straight from the Tsar to the house
of the Drurys, where he was ever a welcome
guest.</p>

<p>Poor Nancy was very miserable at the prospect of
parting with her friend, for she felt that there would
be no more long sledge drives for her over the crisp
snow roads, no more pleasant days in mid-forest
watching for bird and beast, nor jolly skating expeditions
along the smooth surface of the river when the
wind or thaws had cleared it of its deep snow-mantle,
nor happy half-hours spent in laughing over the
hunter's attempts to master the pronunciation of her
own difficult language. Life would be very dull and
miserable for her now, and the colonel informed Boris
that Nancy had even spoken of persuading him, Boris,
to take her with him to the south. "In fact, Boris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
Ivanitch," added Drury, "my wife and I both complain
that you have quite stolen the child's heart
from us; and, if we know anything of Nancy, we
shall have our hands full to manage her while you
are away."</p>

<p>Nancy had disappeared out of the room, for her
feelings had proved too much for her, and Boris
regretfully felt obliged to depart at length without
seeing the child again. But as he groped his way
out of the dark, badly-lighted passage to the front
door, he was surprised by a small, light figure bouncing
suddenly into his arms, and a flaxen head burying
itself in his bosom, while hot tears were freely shed
and hot kisses rained over his face and neck and
wherever the two soft lips could plant them. With
difficulty Boris unclasped the fond arms, and detached
the pretty head from his shoulder, and tenderly
placed the little feet upon the ground. Then Nancy
quickly ran away, and disappeared without a word,
though Boris heard a great sob as the dainty figure
passed out of sight in the dusky distance of the passage.
When the young guardsman, mighty hunter
and redoubtable soldier as he was, left the house and
strode down the familiar street for the last time,
there was a tear in his eye that would not be denied,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
but rolled deliberately down his cheek till it was
dashed away.</p>

<p>On the following morning Boris marched out of
Moscow with his regiment, bound for the seat of war,
far away in the south, on the Sea of Azof.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.<br />

TAKEN PRISONER.</h2>


<p>The fortress of Azof, upon the sea of that name,
was principally used by the Turks and Tartars,
who at this time occupied it, as a centre for
their plundering and marauding expeditions inland.
Some sixty-five years before this, in 1627, the city
had been surprised and captured by the enterprising
Don Cossacks, who found that it lay too close to
their own hunting-grounds to be an altogether acceptable
neighbour. Having possessed themselves of the
city, the Don Cossacks offered it as a free gift to
their liege lord, the then Tsar of Muscovy, Michael,
Peter's grandfather.</p>

<p>The Tsar sent down officers and experts, before
accepting the gift, to report upon the place; but these
announced that the fortress was rotten and indefensible,
and not worth having. The Cossacks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
therefore directed to evacuate the city; which they
did, but not before they had razed every building to
the ground, so that not one stone stood upon another.</p>

<p>But now, at the date of my story, the young Tsar
Peter was full of schemes for aggrandizement by land
and sea; his mind was intent upon fleet-building as
well as upon army-organizing. But the difficulty
was, as one of his intimates pointed out to the Tsar,
"What was the use of building a large number of
ships with no ports for them to go to?" for, besides
Archangel&mdash;which was a terribly long way off&mdash;Russia
had at this time no windows looking out to
the sea. The Baltic was in the hands of Sweden, the
Black Sea was held by the Turk, the Caspian by
Persia. In one of these directions Russia must look
for new outlets to the ocean highroads. Peter's reply
was characteristic. He said, "My ships shall make
ports for themselves"&mdash;a boast indeed, but, as events
showed, not an idle one.</p>

<p>But the question arose, which foreign power should
be first attacked and made to disgorge that without
which the development of Russia was hampered and
impracticable? The Caspian was, after all, but an
inland sea; that could wait. The Baltic was well
enough, but Peter knew that he was as yet quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
unprepared to tackle Sweden, either by land or sea;
that must wait also. There remained the Black Sea.
And here Peter would fulfil a double purpose in
attacking the dominions of the Turk. He would
secure a much-needed port to begin with&mdash;that was
reason sufficient in itself for the contemplated onslaught;
but besides this, he would be dealing a blow
for Christianity by smiting Islamism in its stronghold,
and chasing from their lair the enemies of
Christ.</p>

<p>So Peter decided upon the siege of Azof as a first
step towards greater ends. In 1694 he sent down
from Moscow several regiments of his new troops, the
Preobrajensk, of which the Tsar was himself a member,
having entered the regiment at the very lowest
grade, and enjoying at this time the rank of "bombardier;"
Lefort's regiment of twelve thousand men,
mostly foreigners; the Semenofski, and the Batusitski.
Besides these were our old friends the Streltsi;
and the entire army, numbering one hundred thousand
men, was led by Golovnin, Schéin, Gordon, and Lefort.
Accompanying this force went, as we have seen,
Boris, late bear-hunter, now captain in the Preobrajensk
regiment. Though our friend had bidden farewell
to the Tsar at Moscow, Peter nevertheless changed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
his mind and followed the expedition in person, joining
the troops beneath the walls of Azof, still as
"Bombardier Peter Alexeyevitch," which character he
kept up throughout the subsequent proceedings, being
determined, as an example to his people, to pass
through every grade of both the military and the
naval services.</p>

<p>Boris greatly enjoyed the march southwards. He
welcomed with all his heart the change from the
close, stuffy life in the Moscow drawing-rooms and
barracks to his beloved woods and moors and open
air at night and day. He was the life of the regiment
throughout the long march, entertaining the
officers with exhibitions of his animal-calling talent,
and teaching them the arts of the forest at every
opportunity. Big game naturally kept out of the
way of the great host of men, and never came within
a mile of the road, though answering calls from
wolves might frequently be heard in the distance; but
the officers' mess was indebted daily to Boris and his
knowledge of woodcraft for constant supplies of toothsome
partridge, or delicious willow-grouse, with sometimes
a fine blackcock, or even a lordly capercailzie.
There was no more popular officer of the Preobrajensk
than Boris, whose position was thus very different from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
that he had held in his late Streltsi regiment, where
every officer had been at heart a revolutionist, and
therefore hated him for his known devotion to the
person of the Tsar.</p>

<p>But the long march was finished at last, and the
entire force assembled beneath the walls of Azof.</p>

<p>And now "Bombardier Peter Alexeyevitch" realized
with sorrow that without ships to support his
land forces he was likely to have a tough struggle to
capture the city. When, seventy years before, the Don
Cossacks had surprised and taken it, Azof had been a
very inferior stronghold to this which now frowned
upon him but a mile or less from his outposts. The
new city now possessed a high wall, strongly built,
and likely to defy awhile the assault of the heavy
but feeble ordnance of that time. Peter accordingly
determined, in council with Lefort and the rest, that
rather than lay siege to the place, it would be advisable,
in the absence of ships, to attempt its capture
by assault.</p>

<p>Arrangements were made that the artillery fire
should be concentrated upon that portion of the wall
which appeared to be the weakest, and that the
instant a breach was made the Preobrajensk, supported
by the rest, should advance to the assault and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
carry the town <i>vi et armis</i>. The attack was fixed
for the following morning.</p>

<p>During that evening an unfortunate quarrel took
place between the general Schéin and the principal
artillery officer, a German named Jansen, familiarly
known to the Russian soldiers as "Yakooshka."
Schéin fixed upon one portion of the wall as that
to be attacked, while Jansen was determined that
another spot offered a more suitable mark for the
Russian guns. Schéin insisted, and Jansen, with
blunt German obstinacy, insisted also. Schéin lost
his temper and abused Jansen, when Jansen grew
angry also and said, no doubt, what was unbecoming
in an inferior to a superior officer. Then Schéin lost
control over himself, and commanded the guard to
arrest poor "Yakooshka," whereupon the latter was
led away and actually bastinadoed for insubordination.</p>

<p>That night Jansen escaped from his undignified
captivity, and having first made the round of the
Russian guns and spiked them all, quietly shook the
dust from off his feet, turned his back upon the
Russian lines, and went over to the enemy, being
admitted into Azof by its Mussulman holders with
joy and thanksgiving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>On the following morning, when the order was
given to train the guns upon the city walls and to
open fire, the treachery of Jansen was discovered.
The Bombardier Peter Alexeyevitch, when this information
was brought to him, was a terrible object to
behold. Great spasms of passion shook him from
head to foot, while his face&mdash;black as any storm-cloud&mdash;worked
in contortions and grimaces like the
features of one in a terrible fit. For a few moments
he said no word. Then he took his note-book and
wrote therein large and prominent the name <i>Jansen</i>.
After which he gave orders for the assault of Azof,
guns or no guns, and in a few moments the brave
Preobrajensk were in full career towards the walls
of the city.</p>

<p>The guns opened fire upon them so soon as the
guard became conscious of the surprisingly rash intentions
of the Russians; but the shot flew over their
heads. Boris, mindful of the Tsar's words to him
while still in Moscow, that he should do his best to be
the first man into Azof, led his company cheering and
waving his sword. Russians have never held back
when there was storming work to do, and the troops
advanced quickly at the double, singing, as Russians
love to do, one of their stirring military songs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>The musketry fire opened from the top of the
walls as they came to close quarters, and though the
shooting was very wild, still many wide gaps were
made in the ranks. In a moment the foot of the
wall was reached, and now came the difficult work of
ascending. Scaling-ladders were placed, and knocked
ever from above, and placed again. Scores of men
endeavoured to climb the wall without the aid of
ladders, but were easily shot down or knocked on the
head if they ever succeeded in climbing within reach
of the sharp swords and scimitars waving in readiness
above.</p>

<p>The din was deafening, the cries of Christian and
Mussulman outvying the roar of musketry. Now and
again a squad of Russians firing from below would
clear the wall, and a ladder would be placed for half-a-dozen
brave fellows to rush upwards and be cut
down by new defenders who came to fill the gaps of
the fallen. Once a roar of applause was set up by
the Russian hosts as a Russian officer, followed by
half-a-dozen men, rushed up one of the ladders, and
with a shout of triumph stood upon the top of the
wall, waving their swords, and shouting to their companions
to follow. This triumph was short-lived.
First one man fell, pierced through the heart by a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
bullet; then another and another was knocked on the
head, while those who essayed to come to their rescue
were shot down in their attempt to mount the ladder.
At length there remained alive the officer alone, he
who had first surmounted the wall. This officer was
Boris, whose superior agility had once more stood him
in good stead, and enabled him to climb where the
rest had failed. That same activity appeared, however,
to have got him into a terrible fix. Alone he
stood for a few moments, fighting bravely but hopelessly
against a dozen swords, until at length, to the
consternation of his friends below, he was seen to
receive a blow which tumbled him off the wall upon
the Azof side, and no more was seen of him.</p>

<p>For an hour or more the Russians fought bravely
on, endeavouring to obtain a foothold upon those grim
walls, but all in vain. The Tartar women brought
boiling water and threw it down upon the "Christian
dogs," together with every sort of filth, and large
stones. Every inhabitant of the city appeared to
have come out upon the walls in order to assist in
beating off the infidel; and though many fell pierced
by Russian bullets, they were entirely successful in
their patriotic endeavours, for, with the exception
of the half-dozen men who followed Boris upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
walls, no single Russian succeeded in mounting the
ladders, or in any other way effecting a footing within
the Mussulman stronghold.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the guns of the town, probably aimed
by the treacherous though much provoked Jansen,
rained fire and hail upon the main body of the besiegers,
who, with spiked guns, were unable to retaliate.
Peter the Bombardier was gloomy and black.
He strode among his guns, superintending the efforts
of his smiths to get them into working order; he
swore at his generals right and left, in a manner ill-befitting
a humble bombardier; he swore with yet
more deadly wrath at Jansen, and with greater
justice. But in spite of all his ferocity and fury
he did not lose his discretion; and finding that his
troops were doing and could do no good under present
circumstances, the Tsar gave orders that the
assaulting columns should retire. Thus the day, the
first of many, passed without result.</p>

<p>As time went on, and Peter found that his attacks
upon Azof made no progress, but that he lost daily
large numbers of his best soldiers to no purpose, he
decided reluctantly that until he should become possessed
of a fleet which could blockade the city by sea,
while he attacked it at the same time, and in force,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
by land, he must abandon all hope of capturing the
place. At present, as he had now realized to his loss,
the city could be reinforced and revictualled at any
moment. Besides this, his mainstay in the science
of artillery attack, Jansen, had basely failed him; he
had no one competent to take his place. Such an
officer, together with clever engineers, must be invited
to enter his service as quickly as might be&mdash;an Englishman,
a Frenchman, even a German again, but
not a touchy and quarrelsome and treacherous one,
such as Yakooshka had proved himself.</p>

<p>So Peter wisely, but sorrowfully, abandoned the
siege of Azof for that season, promising himself a
speedy return in the following summer, when he was
fully determined he would possess a fleet capable of
blockading the city from the sea side, as well as capable
and experienced foreign officers, who should lead
his brave fellows to that victory which had been
snatched from them this season through no fault of
their own.</p>

<p>Peter had still much to learn in the art of war;
but, like a man of sense, he accepted defeat on this
and on future occasions as object-lessons for the benefit
of his own inexperience. The great Tsar had his
own patient way of attaining his ends through many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
defeats and much discouragement. He learned from
his enemies at each repulse, assimilating the experience
thus gained until he was in a position, in his
turn, to teach. How thorough was his method of
impressing a lesson upon those who had once been
his teachers, let Pultowa and Nystad testify.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, Peter's rebuff at Azof in 1695 was
to him an exceedingly serious matter in the peculiar
condition of affairs in the Russia of that day; for it
gave to his enemies, and the enemies of progress, the
opportunity to point the finger of scorn at his foreign
soldiers and his un-Russian policy generally, and smile
and say, "Ha, we told you so! these foreigners will
be the ruin of Russia. The priests are right, and we
shall yet see this young man, the Tsar, acknowledge
the error of his ways, and turn his great energies to
clearing the land of the foreigner, with his alien manners
and civilization."</p>

<p>But these men imagined a vain thing; and the
young Tsar, like a young lion, did but shake his
mane and lick his wounded paw, and sally forth once
again to encounter and slay the enemy who had
wounded him.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />

AN EXCITING ESCAPE.</h2>


<p>When the Tsar returned to Moscow and set
himself deliberately to count up his losses,
he was obliged to admit that what affected him more
grievously than anything else was the disappearance
of poor Boris; a disappearance which he could not but
feel certain meant death, or captivity and torture, in
comparison with which death would be vastly preferable.
Peter missed his devoted servant and friend
at every turn and at every hour of the day.</p>

<p>On the second day after his arrival, the Tsar was
surprised to receive a request for an audience from,
as his orderly informed him, "a little English fairy."
Permission being given, the door opened, and in
walked Nancy Drury, now nearly fifteen years old,
and as sweet-looking an example of English maidenhood
as any could wish to see. Nancy was very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
grave and hollow-eyed, and her face showed signs of
many tears.</p>

<p>"Is it true?" said Nancy, advancing towards the
Tsar, and speaking in the hollowest and most tragic
of voices.</p>

<p>"Is what true, my dear?" asked Peter kindly,
taking the child on his knee, though he thought he
knew well enough what she required of him.</p>

<p>"Is it true that he is lost&mdash;my Boris&mdash;and perhaps
dead?" Poor Nancy burst into tears as she spoke
the last word, and hid her face in her hands. "Oh,
what have you done with him, and why did you let
the Tartars have him?" she continued, through sobs
and tears.</p>

<p>Peter did his best to pacify the child, assuring her,
against his own convictions, that Boris was certainly
alive and well, and promising faithfully that at the
renewed campaign next summer his troops should
certainly release Boris from captivity before they did
anything else.</p>

<p>When Nancy had extracted this promise from the
Tsar, she dried her tears, and thanked him and
smiled. Peter kissed the sweet English face. "If
only I were not married already, Nancy," he said,
laughing, "I declare I should be tempted to make an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
empress of you when you were old enough! Would
you like to be an empress?"</p>

<p>Nancy blushed. "I love your Majesty very much,"
she said, "but I would never be empress&mdash;" She
hesitated.</p>

<p>"And why not, my little English fairy?" said the
Tsar kindly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I shouldn't like to live in a big palace all my
life," faltered Nancy. "I love the woods and the
fields, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But if Boris were emperor?" laughed the Tsar.</p>

<p>Nancy hid her face, and flushed scarlet. Then she
jumped off his knee and burst into tears again, throwing
herself at his feet, and sobbing, "Oh, save him
from the Tartars, your Majesty&mdash;do save him! Take
him away from the enemies of Christ, and God will
bless you for it!"</p>

<p>There was not much of the man of sentiment
about this practical young potentate, but Peter could
not help feeling greatly touched to see the child's
anxiety and sorrow. Once more he assured her that
all would be well, and Nancy accepted his assurance
and left the Tsar's cabinet smiling and hopeful.</p>

<p>But my readers will wish to know what has become
of poor Boris all this time. They will think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
very properly, that the fate of a single Christian
falling wounded into the hands of an excited mob
of the children of the Prophet must be pretty well
settled before ever his feet have touched the ground.
So it would be, undoubtedly, in ninety-nine cases out
of a hundred; but Boris was not quite "done for"
when he fell, and therefore the swords and knives
which were anxiously awaiting the opportunity to
dip into his Christian blood were obliged first to
fight for the privilege. He had received a terrific
blow, certainly, but had guarded in time, and though
overbalanced and tumbled off the wall, he was still
unhurt. Regaining his feet in an instant, he had
placed his back against the wall, and stood to receive
attack. Half-a-dozen swords soon sprang out
to give him battle, and in a minute he was engaged
in an encounter compared with which his fight with
the Streltsi was the tamest of toy battles. Boris felt
that there was little hope of his keeping his antagonists
at bay until some of his friends should have
mounted the wall and arrived to give him the much-needed
assistance; but he was resolved, nevertheless,
to keep up the game until either death or assistance
came, and to exact at least twelve Mussulman lives as
the price of his own!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris fought a good fight that day. Turk after
Turk fell before his big swinging sword, and whenever
one fell another took his place. Bravely he
cut and thrust and guarded, and the very Turks
themselves stayed their crowding upon the walls to
see out this fine exhibition of skill and endurance
and Muscovitish pluck. But cutting and thrusting
and guarding one's body from two or three assailants
at once is tiring work, and poor Boris felt his strength
failing him, and his eye grew dim, so that he could
scarcely see accurately where he struck, and some of
his blows began to fall at random. His breath came
and went in gasps, and his arms ached with weariness.
In another moment one of those flashing blades
would find a billet somewhere in the region of his
stout heart, and the career of the brave bear-hunter
would be over and done with.</p>

<p>But fate had decided that the readers of these
records of Boris should have many more pages of his
history to peruse, and just when the hunter was
making up his mind that he had fought his last fight
and lost it, this same fate, in the person of a Turkish
pasha who had watched the fray admiringly from the
beginning, strode up and knocked aside the swords of
the assailants of Boris just in time to prevent them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
from dyeing themselves red in his blood. The pasha
felt that here was a splendid slave being wasted, or
perhaps a prisoner for whom a good ransom might
be eventually forthcoming. So he struck away the
swords, and skipping aside to avoid a savage thrust
from poor dim-eyed Boris, who could not see and
knew not the signification of this new assailant's interference,
he rushed in and pinned the half-fainting
Russian to the wall. The sword dropped from Boris's
hand as the fingers of the pasha closed around his
throat, a thick film came over his eyes, black fog
enveloped his brain, and the shouts and cries of the
battle around him receded further and further into
space; his consciousness faded and failed, his senses
vanished one by one like the extinguishing of candles,
and Boris knew no more.</p>

<p>When Boris came to himself he was in a small
room, whose only window was at a height of some
five feet from the floor and iron-barred. He could
hear a sentinel pass and repass beneath it, and from
a distance came the sounds of musketry and artillery
fire, which quickly recalled to his mind the events of
the morning&mdash;or of yesterday, for he was without
means of ascertaining how long he had remained
unconscious. Food&mdash;some coarse bread and a dish of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
water&mdash;stood upon the floor beside the straw upon
which he found himself outstretched. Boris was
very hungry, and at once ravenously consumed the
food, finishing the bread to the last crumb, and wishing
there were more of it, coarse though it was. He
felt very weary still, and though unwounded, save for
a prick or two in the hand and fore-arm, quite incapable
of and disinclined for thought or exertion. So
Boris lay still, and presently fell asleep.</p>

<p>He was awakened at night by voices as of people
conversing within the room, and opened his eyes to
find the pasha, his captor, with another Turk and a
third figure whose presence first filled him with joy,
and then, as he remembered, with bitter loathing. It
was Jansen, the treacherous gunner, to whose perfidy
and desire for vengeance was due the repulse of
Peter and his army, and, indeed, indirectly, his own
present situation.</p>

<p>Boris was for upraising his voice in angry denunciation
of the traitor, but the pasha dealt him a blow
in the mouth and bade him roughly be silent. Boris
felt for his sword, but found it was no longer at his
side, neither was his dagger nor his big clumsy pistol;
he was entirely unarmed.</p>

<p>Jansen and the Turks were conversing in a language<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
unknown to Boris, the pasha asking questions
and putting down Jansen's replies in a note-book.
Then Jansen, addressing Boris, informed him that the
pasha had spared his life in order to employ him in
his own service, either to teach his soldiers the art of
swordsmanship, in which, the pasha had observed, he
excelled, or perhaps to help him, Jansen, in managing
the big guns mounted upon the walls.</p>

<p>But at this point the tongue of Boris would be
silent no longer, and burst into furious invective.
That this man should desert his master the Tsar in
his need was bad enough, but that the traitor should
expect him, Boris, to employ his skill in gunnery
against his own beloved sovereign and his own people
passed the patience of man, and Boris was with difficulty
prevented from casting himself upon the deserter
and throttling him as he stood. Three swords flashing
out of their scabbards at the same moment, however,
reminded the captive of his helplessness, and
Boris relinquished, reluctantly, the pleasure of suffocating
the traitor.</p>

<p>Whether Jansen persuaded the pasha of the impracticability
of compelling Boris to do any useful
work with the guns, or whether it struck the pasha
that Boris might easily do more harm than good at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
the walls, I know not, but the prisoner was never
requested to take part in artillery practice at the
Russian lines. His duties, he found, consisted chiefly
in helping to carry the pasha's palanquin about the
streets of the city&mdash;an occupation rendered exceedingly
disagreeable by the rudeness of the population,
who pushed, and jostled, and cursed, and spat upon
the "Christian dog" whenever he appeared. Occasionally
he was directed to practise sword exercise
with chosen Mussulman swordsmen; and this he was
glad enough to do, for it gave him amusement in
plenty to teach these Easterns all manner of Western
malpractices, tricks of swordsmanship of an obsolete
and exploded nature such as would undoubtedly
expose them, should they come to blows with an
experienced fencer, to speedy defeat. Besides these
occupations Boris was ever busy in another way&mdash;a
field of activity in which his energies were employed
without the sanction or the knowledge of his master,
for he was labouring every day to loosen the iron
bars of his prison room. By means of peeping out
of his window at moments when the sentry was at
a distance Boris had discovered that between him
and the outer wall of the city there was but a space
of thirty yards of stone pavement, up and down which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
paced the sentinel. Beyond this was the wall; and
over the wall, not indeed the plain whereon the
Russian troops had till lately been encamped, but the
shining waters of that arm of the Black Sea known
as the Sea of Azof.</p>

<p>Day by day Boris worked at his bar, choosing
those moments when the sentinel was farthest from
him. Once, during the sword instruction in the courtyard,
a sword broke, and the broken end of the
weapon, a blunt piece of steel about eight inches in
length, was left on the ground. Boris found an
opportunity to seize this and secrete it before leaving
the spot, and the fragment proved of the utmost
service to him in scraping the mortar from beneath
and around the iron bars. Two months after his
capture Boris saw to his delight that he could now
at any moment he chose remove these bars and attempt
his escape.</p>

<p>The opportunity arrived at last: a warm, dark
night, drizzling with rain; the sentry, muffled in his
<i>bashlik</i>, could see little and hear less; no one else
would be about the walls in such weather and so late.
The bit of sword end, by constant working, had worn
to itself by this time a sharp and formidable edge; it
was no longer a weapon to be despised. In Boris's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
wallet were stored the economized savings of many
meals&mdash;food enough to keep him alive for several
days. The hunter removed carefully the iron bars
which had made this little room a prison-house for
two long months, and clambering upon the somewhat
narrow ledge, sat in the darkness and waited. Would
the sentinel never pass close enough for his purpose?
To and fro the man went, but he did not guess what was
required of him, and passed along rather further from
the window than exactly suited the designs of Boris.</p>

<p>Seeing that the man was evidently a person of
method, and stepped time after time in his old tracks,
Boris determined that he must accept the inevitable
and deal with matters as they were, without waiting
longer for desirable contingencies which destiny refused
to bring about. Standing crouched upon the
ledge, Boris waited until the sentinel was opposite, as
nearly as he could guess in the darkness; then setting
every muscle in his body, he sprang out as far as he
could towards the spot where he judged the man to
be. So vigorous was his leap, that though the soldier
was upwards of five yards from the window, Boris
alighted with tremendous force upon his shoulders,
bearing him to the ground and himself falling over him.</p>

<p>The wretched sentry, conscious only that something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
very heavy indeed had fallen down upon him, apparently
from the skies, was about to howl to his
Prophet for help; but in an instant Boris had one
big hand over the fellow's mouth, and with the other
felt for a spot where a dig of his little weapon might
serve to silence for ever the man's appeals, whether
to Mohammed or to any one else. A quick struggle
as they rolled together on the ground, a sharp dig,
and the sentinel lay still and harmless, and Boris had
accomplished his task so far.</p>

<p>Taking the man's outer garment and bashlik, and
leaving his own, taking also the fellow's musket and
pistol, Boris clambered up the outer wall and looked
for a moment into the darkness beneath. That the
sea was there was certain, for he could hear the
sound of the wavelets lapping the wall below him;
but how far down was the water&mdash;in other words,
how high was the wall?</p>

<p>However, this was no time for anxious reflection.
If Boris ever wished to see his home again, and his beloved
Tsar, and, lastly, his little friend Nancy Drury,
he must jump now and at once. Murmuring a prayer,
then giving one somewhat trembling look down into
the grim darkness beneath him, Boris took a long
breath and jumped.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>It must have been a high wall, for as Boris fell
through the air it seemed to him as though he would
never reach the water. At last he felt the cold
waves close over him, and then it seemed as though
he would never rise to the surface again; but when
his breath was nearly exhausted, and he was well-nigh
choked for want of air, his head emerged once more,
and he was able to float quietly for a while, in order
to obtain a fresh supply of breath, and to listen for
any sound which might either warn him of danger,
or indicate the direction in which he ought to strike
out in order to make the shore.</p>

<p>Presently Boris heard the sound of oars, and
remained where he was until the boat should pass.
It was a party of fishers putting out to sea, and Boris
judged that by going in the opposite direction he
would reach land; so he struck boldly out for the
point whence the boat had come. Soon his intently
listening ears caught the sound of the twittering
of sand-pipers, and Boris guessed that he neared the
shore. This was the case, and in some twenty
minutes from the time of his plunge the hunter had
the satisfaction of feeling the bottom, and of wading,
drenched and somewhat cold, but exceedingly rejoiced,
ashore. There was no one about. The city lay to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
the left; he could hear the crowing of cocks, and
caught the occasional glimmer of a light. Boris took
the opposite direction, and walked along what seemed
to be the edge of an arm of the sea or of a large
river. All night he toiled along, sometimes swimming
or wading, in order to put possible pursuers off the
track.</p>

<p>When morning came, Boris found himself on the
skirt of a large forest, and here he concealed himself,
and dried his clothes and his food in the sun. Then,
deep in the shade of a birch thicket, he lay down
and enjoyed a good rest until the evening, when
he rose up and recommenced his flight, always keeping
to the shore of the river, which, as he afterwards
discovered, was the Don. Thus Boris travelled for
three days, pushing on at night and resting during
the day, until his food was well-nigh exhausted.
Then, to his joy, he reached a rough-looking village
where he found the Russian language was understood.
Here he was received kindly and entertained hospitably
by the rough but good-hearted inhabitants, a tribe
of Don Cossacks; and here he rested for several days,
and collected his exhausted energies amid his kind
Cossack friends, in preparation for the long journey
for Moscow and home!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.<br />

HOME AGAIN.</h2>


<p>One day, early in November 1695, when the
palace of the Tsar in the Kremlin was
thronged with officers and dignitaries awaiting
audience in the ante-chambers, and crowding one
another in the halls and passages, discussing the
news and transacting various matters of state
business, a tall but ragged-looking figure strode in
at the principal entrance of the palace, pushing aside
the doorkeepers, and elbowed his way through the
crowded entrance-hall. Up the wide stairs he went,
taking no notice of the protests and smothered curses
of those whose toes he trod upon, or into whose sides
he had insinuated his sharp elbows. Many of those
who had turned round to see who this audaciously
rough individual might be, stopped open-mouthed
when they beheld him, the protest half-uttered, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
gazed after him with wide eyes, muttering prayers,
as men who believe they see a ghost. But the
ragged courtier looked neither to the right hand nor
to the left, but pursued his reckless march over the
toes of the highest dignitaries in the realm, without
noticing the fact or the persons, and making straight
for the private cabinet of the Tsar as though, until he
should reach that haven, there could be no thought
for anything else.</p>

<p>Arrived at the ante-chamber, wherein were assembled
Lefort and Menshikoff and a few others of
the inner circle of favour, the new arrival paid no
more heed to these august personages than he had
done to the rest, but elbowed them out of his way
and went straight to the door which led into the
sanctum of the great Peter, altogether disregarding
the exclamations of surprise and awe which were all
that these found time to utter as he passed rapidly
through the room and in at the Tsar's own door.</p>

<p>Peter was sitting alone at the writing-table, busily
penning letters to foreign potentates&mdash;applications, in
fact, for the loan of talented engineer and artillery
officers for the new campaign against the Turk on
the Black Sea; a project upon which his mind was
so fixed that his whole time was spent in planning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and organizing it in advance. The Tsar raised his
eyes as the ragged figure entered the room and stood
before his table. But though Peters eyes fixed
themselves upon the strange, wild object before them,
the speculation in them had nothing to do with
the object of their regard. Peter lowered his head
again and wrote; he finished his letter, and signed it.
Then, once more he raised his eyes, and this time
those orbs were looking outwards, not inwards.
Peter started, and spat on the ground; then he
crossed himself, and shaded his eyes, and stared at
the figure that stood before him. For a moment the
strong face looked scared and bewildered; then the
Tsar rose with his big laugh, and walking round to
the other side of the table caught the man by both
shoulders and shook him till his teeth rattled.</p>

<p>"It is true flesh and blood," he cried, "and no
ghost! Boris, my most miraculous of bear-hunters,
whence come you, and why is this ragged body of
yours not eaten by Turkish rats? This is the best
and most wonderful thing that mortal man ever
heard of." Peter drew the grimy traveller to his
own broad breast and embraced him in the most
approved Russian manner, kissing both cheeks and
his forehead.&mdash;"Here! Lefort, Menshikoff, all you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
fellows in there!" continued the Tsar, shouting aloud,
"here's Boris come back, our faithful, Streltsi-sticking,
Turk-spitting Bear-eater!&mdash;Come, sit down, my Boris,
quickly, and tell us all about it. Why are you alive&mdash;have
you a plan of Azof&mdash;how did you get out of
the place&mdash;has that Yakooshka had his sneaking
German tongue cut out of him yet? Tell me that first
of all, quick!"</p>

<p>Boris replied that as far as he knew the head
of Jansen was still upon his shoulders with his
tongue in it.</p>

<p>"Then," said Peter, "we shall have at least the
satisfaction of removing it ourselves instead of relinquishing
the privilege to the Turk, as I had feared."
Peter took two or three turns about the room, looking
his blackest; then he recovered his equanimity.
"Come," he said, "let's talk of pleasanter subjects;
tell us all about your adventures."</p>

<p>Boris told his plain tale amid frequent interjections
from the four or five men present. Peter
roared with laughter over the account of how Boris
with his sword had kept at bay for ten minutes any
number of Turks who chose to come on, and how he
was ultimately scragged by a pasha while in the
very act of fainting from sheer exhaustion. "Bravo,
Bear-eater," he cried, "and bravo again! Ho, if I
had but five thousand bear-hunters like you, my son,
I should attack Sweden to-morrow! But there is
some good in the Turk after all; for think how
easily any one of a thousand of them might have
blown your brains out with musket or pistol. Yet
they preferred to see a good fight out to the end;
but, ha! ha! that pasha. You shall scrag that same
pasha with your own hands, my son, next summer,
as sure as I am standing here. Go on!"</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 585px;">
<img src="images/i_194.jpg" width="585" height="900" alt="" />
<div class="caption">"Out sprang Boris, and alighted with terrific force upon<br />
Menshikoff's back."<br />
<i>Page <a href="#Page_186">186</a>.</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>Peter's pleasant mood underwent a great change
when Boris went on to tell of his interview with
Jansen in prison. His face worked in terrible contortions,
and he rose and paced the room once more
without a word. "So you would have throttled him,
would you?" he said at last. "I am thankful that
you did not interfere with what is my privilege.
Enough about Yakooshka. Go on."</p>

<p>But the Tsar fairly roared with laughter as Boris
described how he had leaped upon the back of the
sentinel, a distance of fifteen feet, and stuck the poor
fellow with his little broken bit of sword-end. He
must have that little weapon, he said, as a keepsake
from his good bear-eater. But nothing would satisfy
the Tsar with regard to the mighty spring upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
back of the sentry but a rehearsal of the feat then
and there, in that very room.</p>

<p>Menshikoff said the thing was impossible; no man,
he said, could leap five yards from a cramped position
upon a window ledge. Boris must have miscalculated
the distance. But Menshikoff regretted this
remark a moment after he had made it; for Peter
declared he believed the bear-eater could perform the
feat if no one else could, and that he should try it
at once, in order to put this sceptic to confusion.
Menshikoff should act the part of sentry, and walk
along while Boris jumped on him. Afterwards they
would all try it. Then two tables were piled together,
and Boris was instructed to bend himself into
the original position as far as possible, and thence
spring upon the unhappy Menshikoff, who paced the
floor at a distance of fifteen feet. Menshikoff eyed
the heavy figure of Boris, soon to be launched at him,
with gloomy foreboding; but there was no help for
it, Peter was in earnest. As Menshikoff reached the
necessary point, out sprang Boris, and without difficulty
covering the distance, alighted with terrific force
upon Menshikoff's back. Over rolled the favourite,
and over went Boris with him, amid the boisterous
laughter of the Tsar and the rest, the crash making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
such a commotion that frightened courtiers from the
room beneath presently rushed in to see what had
happened to his Majesty.</p>

<p>Peter insisted upon attempting the feat himself,
and insisted also that Lefort and Menshikoff should
leap as well. The Tsar easily accomplished the leap;
but so tremendous was the shock of his descent, that
poor Lefort, who was detailed to receive the ponderous
imperial body after its flight through space,
was well-nigh wiped out of the land of the living.
Both Menshikoff and Lefort failed to accomplish the
feat, and Boris was obliged to repeat it, in order that
the Tsar might try the sensations of the sentinel,
as a "bolt from the blue," in the shape of some
thirteen stone of humanity, came crashing down
upon his shoulders. Peter was better built to stand
the shock than the unfortunate Turkish soldier, and
Boris's big body hardly caused him to stagger; though
when the two changed places, and the huge Tsar
sprang through the air and alighted upon the back of
Boris, that hardy young hunter, for all his sturdiness,
rolled over like a rabbit.</p>

<p>Then at length the Tsar, now in the highest good-humour,
permitted Boris to finish his tale&mdash;how he
had plunged into the dark waters of the Azof Sea,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
and found his way to land; how he had been befriended
in a village of the Cossacks of the Don&mdash;Peter
making a note of the name of the village; and
of his long adventurous journey through moor and
forest, where he supplied himself with food from day
to day by means of his knowledge of woodcraft, until
he reached Moscow that very morning. Then the
Tsar informed Boris of his own designs for a renewed
siege of Azof by land and sea, and of all that had
happened in the regiment and out of it since his disappearance.
The officers had all mourned him as
certainly lost, the Tsar said, and had even included
his name in their service for the repose of the souls
of those slain beneath the walls of the city; they
would be overjoyed to see his face again. Then Peter
told of how little Nancy Drury had come to scold him
for losing "her Boris," and of how he had promised
faithfully to go and fetch her friend home again in
the summer. When Peter mentioned Nancy, the face
of Boris flushed, but his eyes glowed with great tenderness;
and presently he asked leave to retire, in
order to visit his fellow-officers, "and others." The
Tsar permitted him to go, on condition that he went
first to see "those others;" for, said Peter, those others
might be even more rejoiced to see him home again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
than the officers of the regiment, who, at least, had
not blushed whenever his name had been mentioned.
Then Boris blushed again, and thanked the Tsar, and
went out to do his kind bidding.</p>

<p>When Boris reached the house of the Drurys, and
was ushered into the sitting-room by the frightened
servant, who took him for a ghost, and did not announce
him because his tongue refused to speak for
very fear, Mrs. Drury was busy over her needlework,
while Nancy sat at her lessons at the same
table. Mother and daughter looked up together, but
their first impressions were entirely different. Mrs.
Drury had never felt the slightest doubt that her
little daughter's faithful friend was long since dead
and buried in the far-away Tartar city, and had
mourned his death in secret, while concealing her
convictions from Nancy, in the hope that when the
truth must be known time would have softened the
blow. When, therefore, the door opened noiselessly,
and the scared servant, speechless and pale, admitted
the ragged figure which so strongly resembled the
dead friend of the family, Mrs. Drury was taken by
surprise, and screamed and hid her face in her hands.
But Nancy's instincts did not err. No sooner did
she raise her eyes than she knew that this was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
ghost, but her own beloved and familiar friend; and
with a cry of great joy and surprise she sprang to
her feet, and was in his arms in a moment, her head
buried in his tanned neck, sobbing and laughing, and
conscious of nothing excepting that here was her
Boris alive and well and come home again.</p>

<p>When Mrs. Drury recovered her equanimity, which
she did in a minute, her English ideas of propriety
were a little shocked at Nancy's undisguised demonstration
towards her friend, and, after warmly greeting
Boris, she reminded her little daughter that her
fifteenth birthday was at hand, and that she would
shock Boris Ivanitch by her demonstrativeness. But
Boris begged her to let Nancy be as affectionate as
she pleased, for, he said, he had sadly needed the comfort
of a little love for many a long and dreary
month. So Mrs. Drury let matters be as they were,
and Nancy clung to her friend's neck, and cried and
laughed in turns, though saying but little, until Boris
gently detached her arms from about his neck and
placed her upon his knee to hear the stirring tale of
his adventures and escape and return home.</p>

<p>Boris left the Drurys' house presently with a new
conviction looming large and prominent in his inner
consciousness, and that was that there was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
in all the world quite so good as the love of an innocent
girl; neither the delights of bear-hunting, nor
the glory of successful fight, nor the favour of a great
king, nor the applause of his fellows, nor rank in the
army, nor wealth, nor the pride of great strength,
nor anything else. All these things were good,
especially the praise of a beloved master and Tsar;
but the clinging arms of this child had revealed a
new yet a very old thing to him, and Boris walked
towards the barracks of the Preobrajensk Guards
on feet that felt not the wooden pavement beneath
them, and with his manly heart so full of tenderness
towards that other confiding and loving little heart
that he almost wished all the world would rise up and
menace that one little child, that he might rise also
and defend her.</p>

<p>Then Boris went and proved for a third time that
he was no ghost, but a solid and able-bodied bear-hunter,
and retold once again the story of his adventures
for the benefit of an admiring mess. Here Boris
learned also from the officers of his regiment that he
had narrowly escaped a shot in the back as he stood
alone upon the wall of Azof; for a former companion
of the Streltsi, one Zaitzoff, had deliberately taken a
shot at him, in order, as he had declared, to pay off<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
old scores. Another member of the corps, one Platonof,
being wounded to death, and horrified at the dastardliness
of the proceeding, had communicated Zaitzoff's
words to the surgeon who attended him. The surgeon
in his turn reported to the officers of the Preobrajensk,
and these took summary vengeance. They
had gone in a body to the Streltsi quarters that very
evening on hearing the surgeon's tale, had pulled
Zaitzoff out of his tent, held an improvised court-martial
on the spot, and shot the miscreant then and
there, and in the presence of all his comrades, who did
nothing to protect him, being themselves horrified with
his action.</p>

<p>One more danger escaped, added to the many, was
as nothing to this man returned, as it were, from the
very gates of death; yet Boris did not fail to offer
thanks for the erring flight of Zaitzoff's bullet when
he counted up the mercies of God on this first evening
of his return, and knelt long and fervently within
the cathedral of the Kremlin. Neither did Nancy
forget to be grateful when she knelt at her bedside
and said her daily prayers, which were the old English
ones, in spite of the fact that Colonel Drury and all
his house were now within the fold of the Russo-Greek
Church and naturalized Russians.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.<br />

OFF TO ENGLAND.</h2>


<p>Bombardier Peter Alexeyevitch entered
with all his impetuosity and marvellous
energy into the preparations for the second attack
upon Azof. During the whole of the winter and
spring he was busy superintending the work of ship-building
in the south of Russia. Every little river
harbour on either side of the Don had its own improvised
ship-building yards, and its hundreds of
workmen from all parts of the country, engaged in
the setting up as quickly as might be of galleys and
rafts and every kind of floating vehicle. "We live,
as old Adam did, in the sweat of our brow," wrote
the Tsar to one of his intimates in Moscow, "and have
hardly time to eat our bread for the pressure of work."
Dockyards burned down, and destroying in their own
destruction the work of many months; gangs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
labourers deserting and disappearing when most required
to complete their work&mdash;nothing could discourage
the great Tsar, or turn him by the fraction
of an inch from the path he had laid out for himself.
Galleys and boats quickly took shape, and gradually
approached completion. Peter was everywhere, swearing,
scolding, encouraging, organizing, never weary,
and never losing heart because of the misfortunes
of the moment. The Don waters rose and carried
away many half-completed vessels and much valuable
timber; but the forests of Voronej were not so far
away nor so poor but that inexhaustible supplies of
birch and oak and pine and beech might be had to
replace what was lost; and these same waters of
the Don which had swept the timber away should be
utilized to carry down on their broad bosom as much
again and more than they had stolen and cast into
the sea. Then Peter himself fell ill; but even sickness
could not quell his ardour for the work he had
set himself, and the building was not delayed for a
moment. At last, when the long nights of midsummer
were near at hand, the flotilla was ready
and slipped down the broad river straight for the
doomed city. There were twenty-two galleys, and
one hundred large rafts for carrying ordnance, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
some seventeen hundred smaller vessels, boats and
lighters.</p>

<p>By this time the regiments from Moscow and the
Streltsi, who had never left the neighbourhood, were
once more assembled beneath the walls of Azof. The
Preobrajensk were there, and among them our friend
Boris, who had spent a delightful winter and spring
in Moscow, and was now ready and anxious for
adventure again. All the troops which had taken
part in the former unsuccessful attack upon the
fortress were now present again to retrieve their
laurels, which had faded before the breath of Turk
and Tartar.</p>

<p>But many new faces were to be seen among the
old ones&mdash;veterans, chiefly, of tanned and foreign
appearance; experienced engineers and gunners from
France, and Hanover, and Brandenburg. Under the
orders of these men a high wall of earth was built
beneath the very ramparts of the city, so that the soil,
when the wall was finished, trickled over the ramparts
of Azof, which it overtopped, and fell into the streets
of the city. At the same time the ships and rafts
blockaded the town from the water side, so that there
was no escape this time by way of the Black Sea.
Then, when all was ready for the attack, preparations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
were made for a combined assault both by land and
sea.</p>

<p>But the hearts of the Tartars failed them, and the
city capitulated before the storming was commenced,
greatly to the disappointment of many young heroes
who had intended to perform deeds of valour, and
especially of the valiant Boris, whose arms ached for
another brush with the Turkish swordsmen, especially
with those who had been so unfortunate as to be
instructed in the art by himself, with whom he had
promised himself much entertainment.</p>

<p>The Tsar spared no pains to discover Boris's friend
the pasha, whom, when found, he placed at the service
of Boris. The hunter, remembering the palanquin,
but recollecting also that he owed to the pasha, in a
fashion, his deliverance from death by the sword, was
merciful, and did but take his fun out of him for
a day or so, after which he released him altogether
and let him go free. But for one day that poor pasha
afforded much amusement to the officers of the Preobrajensk
and to the Tsar also; for Boris harnessed
the poor fat manikin to a light hand-cart, and, himself
sitting as a coachman in front, drove him up
and down the camp, whipping him up with a horse-lash
when he tired, till the wretched Turk was ready<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
to fall between the shafts and expire from pure
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Jansen, who was captured also in the streets of the
city, though disguised in the garb of a common Tartar
tradesman, did not escape so easily. He was carried
in chains to Moscow when the troops returned to the
capital, and there his head was struck off his shoulders
and exhibited on a pole as a warning to traitors.</p>

<p>The army entered Moscow in triumph, under festal
arches made to represent Hercules trampling Turkish
pashas under foot, while Mars, on the summit of a
second triumphal archway, pitched Tartars over in
large numbers. The principal generals were drawn
into the city upon gilded sledges placed on wheels;
while Bombardier Peter Alexeyevitch, now raised,
however, to the rank of captain, walked in the procession
as befitted his humbler grade in the service.
Boris was there, too, in all the glory of a major's
epaulets; and if he had glanced up at a certain balcony
in the Troitski Street as he passed beneath, there
is no doubt that he might have seen two bright eyes
for which he was the centre of the procession, if not
the only figure in it, and which did not fail to notice
with pride the new insignia of rank and promotion
which he bore on either broad shoulder. There, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
in the midst of the happy marching host, was the
wretched prisoner Yakooshka, hooted and spat upon
by the crowd as he dragged his heavily-ironed feet
over the stones of Moscow.</p>

<p>Thus the first triumph of Peter's new army and
navy was achieved with scarcely a single blow struck;
for, with the exception of a brilliant assault upon
redoubts by the Don Cossacks and an easily-repulsed
sortie by the inhabitants, during which but few lives
were lost on the Russian side, there had been no
fighting done. But the prestige of the foreign troops
was won, Peter's policy was justified, the enemies of
Christ and of the true faith had been overthrown, a
seaport had been gained for Russia, and the beginning
of her expansion had become an accomplished
fact.</p>

<p>Peter was thoroughly and entirely happy, for he
had made the first move in the great game he had
come into this world to play, and it was a good move.
The Mussulmans had been hustled out of Azof, and a
garrison of Streltsi left in the city to take care that
they did not return; and now three thousand Russian
families were sent to the town, there to abide for ever,
they and their descendants. Ship-building was commenced
wherever docks could be conveniently erected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and all classes were heavily taxed in order to pay for
the ships to be built in them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, young Russians of talent were despatched
to Venice, to the Netherlands, to London, and to Paris,
in order to learn the newest things, whether in ship-building,
or in gunnery, or in drill and uniform. Their
orders were to keep their eyes open and to see and
learn everything worth learning.</p>

<p>And now Peter felt that he might conscientiously
undertake that trip to foreign lands which he had
long promised himself, and to which he had so ardently
looked forward. He was to travel incognito, in order
to avoid the worry of publicity and the tedious attentions
of courts. The journey was to be undertaken
under the ægis of a great embassy, Peter following in
the train of his ambassadors in the character of a
humble <i>attaché</i> or secretary. Boris was to go, as the
Tsar had long since promised him; for he would be
extremely useful, in England at least, if they ever got
so far, by reason of his knowledge of the language.
Besides, Peter liked to have his faithful bear-eater, as
he still loved to call him, constantly at his side, and
would not have thought of leaving him behind under
any circumstances.</p>

<p>There was one little heart that was sore indeed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
when Boris came to take his leave before the departure
of the embassy. It was always good-bye, Nancy said
wistfully, as the hunter tore himself regretfully from
her side: would there never come a time when she
would not continually be looking forward with dread
to his departure somewhere?</p>

<p>Boris gazed long and earnestly into the sorrowful
blue eyes raised to his own. "Perhaps there
will, my Nancy, perhaps there will," he said at last,
"when you are a little older&mdash;God knows; but I
must always be a soldier and serve the Tsar wherever
he will have me go."</p>

<p>"And I shall always love you and be miserable
when you go away," said Nancy, in perfect sincerity.</p>

<p>Nancy had intrusted to Boris many letters and
presents to her friends and relations in England,
letters in which she had not failed to enlarge upon
the greatness and heroism of the bearer; for she had
extracted a promise that Boris would deliver with his
own hands certain of the packages. There would be
frequent couriers backwards and forwards, so that she
could write to her friend, and he would write too;
so after all Nancy felt there would still be some
comfort in life in spite of the envious fate which so
constantly took her idol away from her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>Then began that historical journey of Peter and his
suite through the Baltic provinces, and Königsberg,
and Hanover, and the Netherlands, where Peter left
his embassy to follow him at leisure while he hastened
on and lived for some weeks at Zaandam as a common
Dutch labourer, in order to learn thoroughly the rudiments
of ship-building, and to set a good example of
industry and self-denial to a lazy and self-indulgent
people at home. The details of Peter's life at Zaandam
are known to the "youngest schoolboy." I need not
therefore dwell upon this hackneyed subject.</p>

<p>Boris had passed with wonder and admiration
through the various foreign lands and courts visited
by the great Muscovite embassy; but there was far
too much eating and drinking and wearing of fine
clothes to please him, and he soon began to weary of
it and think of home and the simplicity of his life in
Moscow, and of hunting expeditions, with Nancy for
companion. Especially after the Tsar left the suite
and went his own way, Boris found life desperately
dull and monotonous. Right glad was he when the
embassy reached Amsterdam and the spell of the
Tsar's presence was once more upon him. Peter had
just been informed that, good as the Dutch ship-builders
were, they were very inferior to those of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
England. This had been quite sufficient for the
energetic Tsar, and Boris found that arrangements
had already been made for a visit to the latter
country.</p>

<p>"So get ready, my bold Bear-eater, for to-morrow
we cross the water. You will be sea-sick, of course;
but then you will see Nancy's native land&mdash;ha, think
of that!"</p>

<p>Boris did think of that, and it rejoiced his heart
to reflect that his eyes should look upon the country
which could produce so wonderful a thing as Nancy
Drury.</p>

<p>So, on the following morning, Peter, with Boris and
fifteen other Russians, took ship in the private yacht
of his Majesty William III., which that monarch had
sent for his accommodation, together with three ships
of war, the whole under the orders of Admiral Mitchell
of the British navy, and crossed the seas for this
hospitable land of Britain. The weather being rough,
Boris was sea-sick, as foretold by the Tsar; but
Peter himself was as happy as a schoolboy out for
a holiday, for that sail in his Majesty's beautiful
yacht, escorted by such ships of war as he had never
yet beheld, was the most delightful thing he had ever
experienced. Such being the case, Peter arrived in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
this country in the highest good-humour, having
familiarized himself on the way with the name and
use of every single object on board the yacht, as well
as with the names, ages, duties, and salaries of every
man and boy that went to make up her crew.</p>

<p>Once on shore, the Tsar would hear no talk of
palaces and luxury and the idle life of courts, but
went with two or three chosen followers and pitched
his tent in a country house close to the shipping at
Deptford, where he was soon busy among the skippers
and sailors, inquiring into and laying to heart everything
that he saw which was likely to prove of service
to him in his own country. And ever at his right
hand, ready for work or for play, though preferring
the latter, was Boris the Bear-Hunter, whose prowess
in all athletic matters Peter was never weary of
showing off to his English friends.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />

HOW BORIS THREW A BIG DUTCHMAN
OVERBOARD.</h2>


<p>But busy as the Tsar was during the daytime,
visiting and inspecting the ships and trade,
and examining the skippers and sailors of all nationalities
as to maritime affairs and other matters
connected with the various countries from which
they hailed, he nevertheless found time at night for
much conviviality and jollification. Menshikoff was
always at hand to bear his master company, but
Boris, being now practically a teetotaller, was allowed
to go to bed instead of taking his share of drinking
and revelling. There were generally guests at these
entertainments&mdash;skippers from English and Dutch
ships, or English friends of low or high degree who
had been fortunate enough to scrape acquaintance
with the big Russian Tsar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>One night there was a guest present, the mate of a
Dutch vessel then lying in the Thames, to whom the
Tsar was much attracted by reason of his great size,
of which the man was exceedingly proud. He was
almost, if not quite, as tall as Peter himself, who,
according to Russian chroniclers, measured six feet
seven inches in height. This person, by name Otto
Koog, had taken his full share of the good cheer
provided by his royal host, and his tongue was freed
so that it spoke many vain things, both of his own
prowess and of the feebleness of other people. There
was no man on this earth, the fellow boasted, whom
he could not put down in fifteen seconds. The Tsar
expressed a great desire to witness an exhibition of
Koog's strength, whereupon Koog said that, with his
Majesty's permission, he would carry Peter and Menshikoff
together three times round the room, like two
babies, one upon each arm. This feat he performed
with ease, though he declared the Tsar to be one of the
finest babies he had ever lifted. Then Peter said that
this was all very well, but could he carry in his arms
a strongish man who was unwilling to be so carried?
To this Koog replied that there breathed not a man
whom he could not lift and carry, whether willing or
unwilling, as easily as a four days' puppy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>"That being so, mynheer," said Peter, "there is one
asleep in the room above us in this very house whom
I should like to see brought downstairs in your arms.
You shall wake him first and pull him out of bed.
Tell him I sent you to bring him down in your hands
as you would carry a baby."</p>

<p>Nothing loath, the big Dutchman left the room, and
soon the Tsar and his guests could hear him blundering
up the wooden stairs. Then came the sound of
his heavy feet upon the floor above, after which a
ponderous bump, as of a great body falling upon the
ground, this being followed by the noise of talking.</p>

<p>Next began rushings to and fro, bumpings and
thumpings on the floor, crashing of glass, and smashing
of crockery and furniture; then more jumping
and tumbling, with occasional loud shouts. Then
came the banging open of a door, and the stumbling
and sliding footfall as of one descending the stairs
with difficulty. Next there was much struggling at
the door of the room, with kickings at the panels of
the door; and presently the hinges flew asunder and
a big Russian boot appeared through the panels, and
into the chamber walked Boris, carrying in his arms
Mynheer Otto Koog, whose kickings and strugglings
scattered many bottles as the young Russian deposited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
his burden upon the supper-table before the Tsar in
the centre of a large dish of stew.</p>

<p>Then the Tsar and his guests began to laugh and
applaud, and laugh again when Boris wiped his brow
with his hand, and with mock gravity said, "Supper
is served, your Majesty."</p>

<p>Koog declared that he must have drunk more than
was good for him, or no man on earth could have
done what Boris had done this night. But the Tsar
laughed, and maintained that drunk or sober Koog
would find his bold bear-eater a pretty tough customer.</p>

<p>Then Koog, in the smart of defeat, challenged Boris
to a wrestling match on board his own ship, the
match to take place on the following morning, and
the victory to belong to him who should first succeed
in pitching the other overboard into the water. The
Tsar did not wait for Boris to express any opinion
on this matter, but immediately accepted the challenge
in his name for ten o'clock on board the <i>Zuyder
Zee</i>.</p>

<p>When the morning came rain was falling heavily,
which made the deck of the Dutch ship, upon which
this wrestling match was to take place, very wet and
slippery. Koog had put on his string slippers, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
would give him a far better hold of the wet deck
than would be afforded by the thick Russian boots
which Boris wore. Nevertheless, the hunter made no
objection, and took his stand opposite to his antagonist,
both being stripped to the waist.</p>

<p>The Dutchman was by far the taller and heavier
man, but what Boris lacked in weight he made up
in the spring and agility of his movements. At the
word to commence, given by the Tsar himself, the
big Dutchman sprang at Boris, and clasping him by
the waist raised him some inches from the ground,
and actually made as though he would end the battle
in its earliest stage by carrying the Russian to the side
of the ship, and fairly hoisting him over the bulwark.
But the hunter had no intention of allowing the fight
to close before it had fairly begun. He struggled in
Koog's arms until his feet were once more upon the
ground, when he, in his turn, clasped his antagonist
by neck and waist, and the wrestle began in earnest.
For full half-a-minute neither Dutchman nor Russian
obtained any advantage; if Otto succeeded in pushing
Boris a few inches nearer to the ship's side, Boris
quickly recovered his lost ground. Then, of a sudden,
the hunter's foot slipped on the wet deck, and in an
instant he was prone at the feet of the other. Koog
was all ready to take advantage of this misfortune,
and before the Russian champion could recover himself
he seized him in his arms, as though he carried
a baby, and sprang with him to the side of the vessel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 585px;">
<img src="images/i_220.jpg" width="585" height="900" alt="" />
<div class="caption">"Boris lifted his kicking legs and slid them over the bulwark."<br />
<i>Page <a href="#Page_210">210</a>.</i></div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>For a moment Peter and the crowd of spectators
thought that it was all up with the chances of poor
Boris, and looked over the side to see him go splashing
into the water beneath.</p>

<p>But Boris was far from being beaten yet. He laid
hold of a rope which formed part of the rigging of
the ship, and to this he clung so tightly that all the
efforts of the mighty Dutchman could not compel him
to relax his hold. Suddenly, however, he did relax
his hold, and this just as Koog gave so violent a
pull that when the resistance unexpectedly failed, he
staggered backwards. At the same moment, Boris
twisted in his arms, and feeling the ground once more
with his feet, pushed so vigorously at his antagonist
that Otto fell violently backwards with Boris on the
top of him. They both rolled about for many minutes,
first one being uppermost and then the other, until by
mutual consent they both rose to their feet in order
to start fair once more; and thus ended the first round.</p>

<p>Then began the final stage of the contest. Three
times Boris forced Koog to the bulwark, but could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
get him no further; and twice the bear-hunter was
himself well-nigh hoisted over the side. Then, at his
fourth attempt, Boris drove Koog backwards till his
back touched the bulwark; there, closing with him,
with a desperate effort he lifted the ponderous Dutchman
till Koog sat upon the rail. Then Otto, in desperation,
hitched one foot around an iron stay which
stood up against the bulwark, and pressed forward
with all his weight and strength upon the champion
of Russia, who, in his turn, did all that lay in his
power to force the Dutchman backwards; and so the
pair remained for upwards of a minute, straining, and
hissing, and panting, and sweating, while the fate of
Koog hung in the balance.</p>

<p>Then suddenly Boris relaxed, for an instant, his
pressure upon Otto's shoulders, though without losing
his grip. The strain removed, Koog's body fell forwards,
while his leg flew up, having released itself from
the stay. Instantly Boris stooped, and with one hand
laid hold of the Dutchman's baggy trouser leg, while
with the other he continued his pressure upon the
shoulder. Backwards went the Netherlander, slowly
but surely; his balance was lost, and so, for him, was
the fight. Deftly Boris lifted his kicking legs and
slid them over the bulwark, bending them back over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the body, which was now in full retreat towards the
water, and in an instant the big man splashed into
the waves and the muddy Thames closed over his
head. So fatigued was the Dutchman with his exertions
that he could barely keep afloat, and was quite
unable to swim a stroke; he floated away gasping
and sputtering, and the crew of a neighbouring vessel
fished him out with a boat-hook and ropes.</p>

<p>Great was the joy of the Tsar over this victory
of his champion. Peter hoisted Boris upon his own
shoulders, and carried him round and round the ship,
amid the cheers and laughter of many spectators, not
only on board the <i>Zuyder Zee</i>, but also upon many
other vessels anchored near her.</p>

<p>After this triumph, the Tsar was still more anxious
to pit his Russian champion against those of other
nationalities, and involved poor Boris in many defeats
by reason of this passion. As an instance, a coal
miner from Cumberland, and a champion wrestler of
that county, was hunted up by the Tsar and pitted
against Boris for a match. In the skilled hands of
this man, poor, untutored Boris was as a child in
arms. The Cumbrian threw him again and again,
adopting at each attempt a new device of the many
known to him, and every one of them sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
topple over the Russian like a nine-pin. Boris, and
Peter also, were to learn that mere strength and
activity were insufficient to cope with equal, or even
inferior strength, scientifically exercised. But in
spite of this, Boris, after having fallen heavily six
times, ended the fight in a manner unexpected by his
adversary, and little to his taste. The match took
place on the deck of a collier, and at the seventh
round Boris, suddenly bending before his antagonist
could lay hold of him, caught the Cumbrian champion
by the knees, and lifting him by a tremendous
effort, sent him flying over his shoulder, and over the
side of the ship also, into mid-river, where the poor
man would have been drowned had not Boris himself
gone to his assistance.</p>

<p>Peter gave the Cumbrian champion a present in
money, and offered him handsome wages to come over
to his country and teach the Russians to wrestle. But
the man of Cumberland looked knowingly at the Tsar,
and refused the offer; he would rather stay, he said, in
a country "where men did not eat their own kind,"
even though at a lower rate of wages. In vain the Tsar
assured him that in Russia men are not cannibals; the
sturdy north countryman only looked the more knowing,
and the negotiations ended where they began.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>Then, again, Boris was required to run races with
sundry champions, who easily defeated him, as was
natural; though he held his own in jumping. At
swimming, however, even the best of his English competitors
were obliged to take a second place, for Boris
excelled any who were pitted against him, especially
in the longer races.</p>

<p>In the noble science of self-defence Boris, though
untutored, surprised every one by his aptitude. It
was not that he was skilled either in defence or in
attack; but his eye was good and his natural guard
excellent, while his enemies, or rather antagonists,
declared that it was one of the most disagreeable
things in the world to receive a blow straight from
the Russian's shoulder.</p>

<p>Thus, though often worsted in the competitions
wherein, by the desire of the Tsar, he tried his
strength and agility against the best foreign exponents,
Boris on the whole held his own against all
comers, and the Tsar declared himself well satisfied
with his faithful bear-hunter, who had upheld, to the
best of his ability, the claim of far-away Muscovy
to compete with the rest of the world in trials of
strength and pluck and endurance. It was, indeed,
a matter of no little pleasure and encouragement to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Peter to find that he was able to produce a picked
man who had proved himself as good as, and sometimes
better than, the picked men of other nationalities.
The circumstance led him to hope that his
Russians, when instructed by qualified tutors, would
show themselves worthy to take their proper place in
Europe, and to hold their own whether on the battle-field
or on board ship, as he would assuredly call
upon them to do ere many years were past.</p>

<p>Besides all this, Peter saw and did much, during
his stay in London, with which our bear-hunter was
not so immediately connected; but for a short account
of his doings and seeings among our forefathers in
this merry land of England, I must refer my readers
to the following chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />

BAD NEWS FROM MOSCOW.</h2>


<p>To Admiral Carmarthen, of the British Navy,
Peter of Russia was indebted for one of the
supremest pleasures of his life. This was a review,
or naval sham-fight, which the admiral organized for
the Tsar's benefit at Spithead. We can imagine how
Peter, whose heart was so set at this time upon
ships and all matters connected with the sea and
maritime affairs, must have gazed in rapture and
delight at the beautiful battle-ships that man&oelig;uvred
before his eyes; how he must have knit his strong
face, and bent his eagle glance which nothing ever
escaped, upon each turn and evolution of the vessels,
and watched each man&oelig;uvre, drinking in for his
future guidance the reason for every movement made
and the probable result, had this been actual warfare,
of every gun fired. There is no doubt that the young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
autocrat learned much from this memorable scene,
and laid to heart many hints to be utilized afterwards
when he himself, in command of a Russian
fleet, engaged and overcame a stronger fleet of the
King of Sweden.</p>

<p>Peter's delight with the day's entertainment may
be gauged by his conversation, when it was ended,
with Admiral Carmarthen. "Admiral," he said, "you
are a lucky man! I would rather be the admiral of
a British fleet such as this than the Tsar of all the
Russias!"</p>

<p>Probably Peter's excited state of mind was responsible
for this somewhat exaggerated manner of expressing
his satisfaction; but there is no doubt that
his enthusiasm and delight were perfectly sincere at
the time. Boris was present also, and his delight
was no less than that of his master. He, too, felt
that it must indeed be a delightful position to be
in command of so magnificent a sea-army as this.</p>

<p>"Boris, Boris!" said Peter, as the two tall men
stood side by side watching the beautiful spectacle,
"shall I ever own a fleet like this, and a good seaport
to keep it in?"</p>

<p>"That depends upon your Majesty," said Boris.
"Every one knows that Peter Alexeyevitch will perform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
anything to which he puts his hand and sets
his heart!"</p>

<p>"Ah, Boris," said the Tsar, "I thought so too
before we left Russia; but I am humbler now! Oh,
for the sea, my Bear-eater&mdash;the sea! that is what we
must fight for and live for. Our poor Russia is
cramped and stifled for want of windows; we must
break through her walls, Boris, and that as quickly
as possible. I can build a fleet, there is no fear of
that. If we had but a hundredth part of the seaboard
that these happy Britons possess, I should be
blessed indeed!"</p>

<p>"Never fear, your Majesty; we shall have seaports
yet!" said Boris, to whom the matter presented
no difficulty whatever, for did not Peter
desire it?</p>

<p>As the Tsar and his henchman walked through
the streets of London, they attracted considerable
attention by reason both of their size and of the
conduct of Peter, whose actions were at times very
eccentric. He would stop people in the street, in
order to ask questions as to the make of their clothes
and hats and watch-chains. Once he seized the wig
of a passing pedestrian, to that individual's surprise
and alarm, who thought he had to deal with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
gigantic lunatic. Peter carefully examined the wig,
which was of a new-fashioned shape and did not
please him, gave a short laugh and a grunt of disgust,
and clapped it back upon the man's head so violently
that the unfortunate fellow nearly fell forward upon
his nose. He would enter jewellers' and other shops,
and question the artificers very minutely as to their
trade and craft, frequently ending the conversation
by inviting the shopman to remove his business to
Moscow, where he should be assured of a fine trade
among Peter's subjects. Sometimes these offers were
accepted, and numbers of goldsmiths, blacksmiths,
gunsmiths, joiners, and other skilled workmen were
prevailed upon to travel to the far north, where they
were subsequently well treated and made fortunes
for themselves, while they were useful in teaching
their crafts to the Russian people.</p>

<p>Couriers frequently passed between London and
Moscow, and through their good offices Boris was
able to keep up a constant communication with
his friend Nancy. The hunter was no great hand
at letter writing, though he had long since learned
the arts of reading and writing, of which of course
he had been ignorant while still the bear-hunter
of Dubinka. In one of his epistles Boris wrote to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
this effect, the letter being partly in English and
partly in Russian:&mdash;</p>

<p>"His Majesty is exceedingly pleased with this
city [London], wherein are more people than would
fill a score of Moscows. The people are kind and
hospitable, but somewhat boastful, and think but
little of the Russians. His Majesty deigns to take
his pleasure in causing me to wrestle and otherwise
contend with great wrestlers and swimmers and
fighters of the English. In these matters there are
some experter than I, excepting in swimming. I
have seen your friends and delivered your letters
and packages, wherewith all were greatly pleased.
Your friends made much of me, far more than I
deserve. For their kindness I am indebted to you,
and also for many good words spoken of me in your
letters, portions of which they read to me.</p>

<p>"The Tsar and I had an adventure last night which
might have ended in bloodshed, but ended actually
only in laughter; for we were fallen upon by robbers,
of whom there were five, in an outlying, lonely part
named Hampstead. The robbers surprised us in the
midst of this place, and would, no doubt, have cut
our throats, but that his Majesty and I, being armed
with thick oaken sticks, kept them at bay, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
process of time banged two of them on the head. The
rest his Majesty, with some assistance from me, pitched
into a small pond covered with green ooze, whence
they issued half-drowned, and ran to their homes."</p>

<p>Nancy, on her part, told all the Moscow news
and the progress of the ship-building throughout the
country, of which she heard much talk, for every one
spoke of it. Nancy also mentioned that many reports
were being disseminated in Moscow by the
priest party to the effect that the Tsar had been
drowned on his way to England. Others said that
he had been captured by the Queen of Sweden,
placed in a barrel, and rolled into the sea. The
motive of these reports was obvious. If Peter were
dead, his widow, or his brother, or his son would be
proclaimed head of the realm, and in any case his
policy would be reversed; foreigners would be sent
out of the country, and Russia given back to the
Russians. It may be mentioned in this connection
that so deeply was the belief in Peter's death at this
time rooted in the minds of hundreds among the
lower classes, both in Moscow and throughout the
country, that to their dying day many of these
believed that the man who returned eventually from
abroad, and assumed the government of the realm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
though he certainly resembled Peter, was an impostor
and a pretender, and that the real Tsar lay drowned
at the bottom of the North Sea.</p>

<p>During his stay in London, Peter had many opportunities
of conversation with all classes of the
subjects of William III. He visited country houses,
where he startled the sober rural folks by the
eccentricity of his manners&mdash;loving to amuse himself
in rough and barbarous ways, such as causing
Boris to wheel him, afterwards himself wheeling Boris,
in a barrow through a massive holly hedge at Saye's
Court. The Tsar could not endure the ways of
refinement and luxury, and preferred to sleep on the
floor rather than in a grand bed, and loved to drink
quantities of English beer, which he condescended to
admire.</p>

<p>Boris thought little of England from the point
of view of the hunter. There were no woods, he
said, fit to hide a bear or a wolf; as for hunting the
fox, it was poor sport. The country was well enough,
but not in his line; he preferred the broad forests of
his native land, and the excitement and danger of
hunting big game. In a word, Boris was well tired
of England when, at the end of a few months, Peter
declared that he had seen enough, and would now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
depart homewards, taking Vienna on the way, and
travelling slowly in order to see as much as possible
of every country visited.</p>

<p>The English king made Peter the most acceptable
of presents at parting, in the shape of a small frigate
of twenty-four guns. The delight of the Tsar in his
new possession was immense, and his return voyage
to Holland was made aboard of this vessel. But
Peter, too, desired to offer a memento of his visit to
the hospitable British sovereign, and did so in a
characteristic manner; for, while bidding William
farewell, he pressed into his hand a small object
wrapped in a piece of dirty brown paper, which he
took out of his waistcoat pocket. This proved to be
a magnificent ruby, and was valued afterwards at ten
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>So the Tsar and Boris and the rest took ship and
set sail for Holland in the frigate which the English
king had presented to his Russian brother. And
that voyage came well-nigh to being the last that
any of the party were to undertake; for a terrific
storm arose in the North Sea, and for a day or two
they were uncertain whether they should live or die.
The Tsar's suite were greatly concerned at their
master's danger, knowing well that the destiny of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
Russia was kept by this man in the hollow of his
hand. But Peter himself professed to have perfect
confidence in the happy outcome of the voyage; he
inquired of his long-visaged companions whether
they had ever heard of a Tsar of Russia being
drowned in the North Sea? All admitted that they
certainly never had read of such a disaster! "Very
well then," said Peter; "I don't intend to be the first
to set the example!" Whereupon the suite took
heart of grace, and trusted to the good luck of the
Tsar to pull them through, which it did; for the
good ship sailed safely into port, and was then sent
round to Archangel, while the Tsar and his embassy
continued their journey by land, and in due course
arrived at Vienna.</p>

<p>Here Peter had intended to stay some little while,
in order to learn whatever the Austrians might have
to teach him; but disquieting news came from
Moscow, which compelled him to give up the contemplated
visit, and to make all the haste he could
towards his own capital. So bad was the news,
indeed, that the Tsar was at his blackest and
most savage during the whole of the hurried journey
home, and those pleased him best who talked least,
and left him most alone to his gloomy thoughts.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
Like a storm-cloud that rushes over the face of the
sky, the angry Tsar flew over the hundreds of miles
that lay between him and the objects of his wrath;
and like the piled-up masses of black vapour that
burst and vomit forth water and lightning, so burst
the anger of Peter upon those who had vexed him,
when, a very few days after receiving the news, he
dashed into Moscow with a few attendants only, the
rest following as quickly as they could.</p>

<p>The purport of the letter received by Peter in
Vienna was certainly disquieting enough, for the
epistle contained an account of a military revolt,
and of a march upon the capital by the Streltsi. It
appeared that these regiments, ever on the watch for
opportunities of interfering in existing affairs, had
sent a deputation to Moscow to inquire into the truth
of the rumours as to the absence or death of the
Tsar, and to demand of the authorities orders for
the immediate return of all the Streltsi regiments
to Moscow. Their wives and families were still in
the capital, and they had been absent long enough at
Azof and elsewhere. Besides, political affairs
demanded their presence in the capital.</p>

<p>The deputation were unable to obtain the ear of
the authorities, and were dismissed with scant ceremony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
from Moscow&mdash;very loath to leave the city, and
extremely angry with those who would not listen to
their grievances.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the main body of the Streltsi had
become impatient, and sent word that, if not summoned
to Moscow in compliance with their request,
they intended to come without waiting for an invitation.</p>

<p>It was at this stage of affairs that letters were
despatched to the Tsar at Vienna, summoning him to
his capital, which was menaced by a descent upon
it by the dissatisfied Streltsi regiments.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, however, the two generals, Schéin and
Gordon, whom Peter had left at the head of military
affairs in his absence, proceeded wisely to take the
bull by the horns. They prepared a moderate force,
selected from the new regiments, and marched towards
the seat of disturbance.</p>

<p>Before they had gone very far they met emissaries
from the Streltsi, who informed them that the massed
regiments of that body were in full march upon
Moscow, with intent to chase the foreigner from the
soil of holy Russia; to place the Grand-Duchess
Sophia, late regent, upon the throne in lieu of the
Tsar Peter, who, they had heard, was dead; and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
restore the old <i>régime</i> and the good old days of a
Streltsi-dominated Moscow, without a foreigner in
the place to set everything upside down and worry
the souls of the priests.</p>

<p>Gordon sent these men back with a message to
their comrades to get home as quickly as might be to
their quarters, and there to pray Heaven to so rule
the heart of the Tsar Peter (who was quite alive
enough to cut the throat of every Streletz in Russia),
that he might be led to look with indulgence upon
their foolish imaginings, and forgive them in consideration
of their instant and complete submission,
tendered from their barracks.</p>

<p>But the Streltsi would not believe the words of
Gordon, and declared that they must and would come
to Moscow in order to see with their own eyes that
all was well with the Tsar and the country.</p>

<p>Thereupon Gordon and Schéin met these misguided
men half way as they marched upon Moscow. The
Streltsi would not surrender at demand, and therefore
a volley was fired over their heads. This set the
brave fellows running, which proved that their
courage was scarcely equal to the noise they made
in the world. Three thousand of them were taken
prisoners and brought to Moscow; the rest were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
permitted to escape and return to their own quarters.</p>

<p>Such was the state of affairs when the enraged
young Tsar dashed into Moscow in his angriest and
blackest mood, and with his mind set upon making a
terrible example of this body of men, who had been
a thorn in the flesh to him since his first experience
of their eccentricities, at the age of ten.</p>

<p>How he carried out his intentions, and the bearing
which this affair had upon the career of our bear-hunter,
shall be treated of in the following chapter.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />

BORIS IN DISGRACE.</h2>


<p>The page of the history of Peter of Russia which
I must now briefly refer to is stained and
blurred with the records of ferocity and brutality,
and I am sure my readers will thank me if I give
as cursory an account of the Tsar's terrible mood of
cruelty as is barely necessary for the thread of my
own tale. This is the blackest period of Peter's life,
if we except perhaps his persecution in later years of
the unfortunate Grand-Duke Alexis, his utterly unworthy
son; and for those who are sincere admirers
of the genius and self-denial of the great Tsar, and of
his many remarkable and wonderful gifts and graces
of mind and disposition, the record of his treatment
of the Streltsi at this time affords extremely unpleasant
reading.</p>

<p>Peter's first step was to form a court of inquiry, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
inquisition, on a gigantic scale. For many weeks
this court continued its labours of investigation, examining
the captured soldiers and officers at great
length and with extreme persistency, in the hope of
extracting from them minute details of the conspiracy
which had culminated in the revolt and march upon
Moscow. The object of the Tsar was to obtain the
names of all those connected with the plot who were
outside the ranks of the Streltsi, and more especially
to discover proof of the participation of his sister
Sophia, the late regent, in the affair.</p>

<p>To this end horrible tortures by scourge and fire
were daily inflicted upon the unfortunate Streltsi,
who very soon confessed all they knew, which was
the very simple fact that the priests had persuaded
them that Peter was dead, and that they had therefore
determined to come to Moscow in order to request
Sophia, the Grand-Duchess, to take in hand measures
for the legal succession to the throne. Also, they
were anxious to see their wives and families, from
whom they had been, as they imagined, unfairly
separated. Not a man among them, either by torture
or of free will, could be made to say that the Grand-Duchess
had stirred up or in any way encouraged the
rising. They had, indeed, brought a letter for Sophia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
begging her to act as regent and to reinstate themselves
in Moscow, dismissing the foreigners and disbanding
the new regiments; but Sophia herself had
known nothing of the letter or of their intentions.</p>

<p>The Grand-Duchess and those around her were
exhaustively examined, though not by torture, as to
the truth of these statements; and the investigators
could find no reason to believe that it was otherwise
than as declared by the Streltsi.</p>

<p>Foiled in his attempt to dig down to the roots of
this matter, but unconvinced that his sister and others
were innocent, Peter then proceeded to wreak his
vengeance upon the Streltsi themselves. The Tsar
was determined that this festering sore in the side of
Russia should be healed once for all. The Streltsi, if
allowed to remain in their old strength and numbers,
and with their traditions of privilege and license of
interference undisturbed, must for ever be a fruitful
source of disturbance, and an element of danger to
the state. They must be exterminated, root and
branch, as an institution. But first these ringleaders
must be dealt with; and here Peter determined to
make a terrible example. Nearly two thousand of
the unfortunate prisoners, together with a number of
priests who were proved to have been implicated in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the rising, were put to death in the streets of the
city. One man was left hanging close to the window
of the Grand-Duchess Sophia, holding in his dead
hand the letter which the Streltsi had intended to
present to her, in order to show Peter's half-sister how
little he believed in her protestations of innocence.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to enter into any details of
the horrors of this time, but one circumstance must
be mentioned in connection with all this brutality and
bloodshed, because it bears upon the career of our
friend Boris, who was at this time forced into taking
a step which was pregnant with changes in his life
and prospects.</p>

<p>The Tsar, lost in these dark days of vengeance and
brutality to all sense of propriety and moderation,
decreed that his nobles and favourites should all take
a hand in the barbarities being enacted&mdash;should, in a
word, assist in the death of the mutineers. Some of
Peter's intimates, either brutal enough to enjoy the
work or else anxious to please the Tsar, cheerfully
consented to do as he had requested them. Others
protested, and with tears besought his Majesty to
exempt them from so unworthy a duty. But the
maddened young autocrat was firm, and insisted upon
the carrying out of his commands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>What misguided motive Peter can have had for
this outrageous piece of brutality it is impossible to
determine; but since he never acted without motive
of some kind, it is charitable to suppose that he
believed he fulfilled some subtle purpose in commanding
these men to do his savage will. Perhaps he
desired to impress upon his favourites the awful
consequences of treason to his person, by means of
an object lesson which would linger in their minds
as long as they lived, and thus effectually deter them
from ever entertaining the idea of disobedience. It
was a terrible lesson, whether required or not, and
we may safely suppose that no man who was concerned
in those scenes of violence and cruelty ever
forgot the experience. The Streltsi behaved with
exemplary bravery, and laughed, and sang soldier-songs,
and prayed aloud upon the scaffold, until death
stilled their tongues.</p>

<p>But there was one man who neither at the request
nor at the command of the Tsar would take a hand
in the horrors of the day, and that man was Boris.
Among the captured and condemned Streltsi were several
members of the hunter's old regiment (which had
revolted with the rest), one or two of whom had in
former days crossed swords with Boris on a memorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
occasion; indeed, two of them were of the party
who had lurked in the dusk of the Moscow street-corner
in order to assassinate him.</p>

<p>One morning, when Boris paid his usual visit to
the cabinet of the Tsar to hear his Majesty's commands
for the day, he found the latter pacing rapidly up
and down the apartment, black and gloomy, as he
ever was at this time. None had ever known the
Tsar's savage mood to last for so long as it had continued
on this occasion. Since the day when, in
Vienna, the letter of Gordon had been brought to him,
the "black dog" had sat upon his Majesty's shoulder,
and there had been no gleam of even transient sunshine
to dispel the clouds that overcast his soul.
Peter was not himself. He had been worked up by
his passion into a condition of mind in which his
own intimate friends failed to recognize their rough
but ever kind and indulgent master.</p>

<p>At this present moment Boris could plainly see
that rage had full possession of his Majesty's spirit.
He took no notice of him beyond glaring fiercely at
him as he entered, and said no word of greeting.
Boris had been bitterly affected lately, not because of
Peter's neglect of himself&mdash;for that, he knew, would
mend with brighter days&mdash;but because the dreadful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
savagery which the Tsar had shown at this time
revealed his beloved master in a character which the
hunter had not seen before; a revelation which filled
him with a shocked sense of pain and disappointment
very hard to bear.</p>

<p>Peter continued to stride up and down the room,
muttering to himself, and spoiling the rugged beauty
of his features by twisting them into contortions and
grimaces as the passion worked within his soul. At
last he stopped. Then he raised his eyes and saw
the hunter, who lingered near the door.</p>

<p>"Ah! it's you, is it?" he said. "It is as well you
have come, for I have special work for you to-day.
There are some old friends of yours, I find, among
these accursed ones, the Streltsi prisoners."</p>

<p>The heart of Boris sank, for he guessed what was
coming; many of the Tsar's intimates having already
been told off to do his savage will, and he knew that
his turn was come.</p>

<p>"I have reflected that it would be only fair," continued
the Tsar, "to allow you the privilege of paying
off old scores. Since these men are sentenced to
death, there is none who could so fitly carry out the
sentence as yourself."</p>

<p>"Your Majesty must excuse me," said Boris, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
was more of the athlete and soldier than the orator;
"I am an officer, not an executioner."</p>

<p>The Tsar's face worked. He glared savagely at
Boris for the space of half a minute; then he laughed,
but not in his old hearty way.</p>

<p>"You are a bold man, whatever else you may be,"
he said. "Now listen. It is my desire that you take
this axe"&mdash;here his Majesty produced a workman's
hatchet from a grim pile beside his table&mdash;"and with
it proceed to that corner of the Uspensky where these
men or others of the same regiment once attempted
your life. There you will find a block already erected,
and upon that block you shall execute these three
men&mdash;Michael Orlof, Vladimir Donskoi, Feodor
Latinski." The Tsar read these names from a slip
of paper which he took from his table.</p>

<p>But Boris still preserved a bold front. He raised
himself to his full height, looking very proud and very
handsome, and almost as big as the Tsar himself, who
appeared somewhat bent and borne down by the evil
days and more evil passions which had fallen upon
him.</p>

<p>"I have told your Majesty I am no executioner,"
repeated the hunter, regardless of the passion of the
Tsar. "Command me to fight these men, all three at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
once if you will, with the sword, and I will obey your
bidding this very hour, and your Majesty knows
enough of me to accept my promise that not one of
them shall remain alive; but as for beheading them
in cold blood with yonder axe, I cannot and I will not
do the deed."</p>

<p>Boris felt that in taking this bold course he was
probably, in the Tsar's present humour, signing his
own death-warrant; yet he knew also that he would
sooner die than do this detestable thing that Peter
would have of him.</p>

<p>The Tsar bit his lip till the blood showed red on
the white. "Boris Ivanitch, I entreat you," he
muttered, "do not anger me more. By the mercy of
Heaven, I know not myself at this time. I repeat to
you that I am to be obeyed. Take this axe and do
my bidding&mdash;go!"</p>

<p>But Boris stood straight and firm, and looked the
Tsar boldly in the eyes. His blood was up and his
stubborn spirit was in arms. He seized the axe which
Peter held out to him and flung it crashing to the
farthest end of the room.</p>

<p>"No," he said, quietly but with firm lips and erect
form, "I am not a slave. I love your Majesty, but
your way this day is not God's way. Not even the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Tsar shall force me into doing this ungodly and
detestable deed!"</p>

<p>The Tsar recoiled, his face livid and bloodless, and
his features convulsed with the passion that beset
him&mdash;drawing his sword as he stepped backwards.</p>

<p>Boris thought that his end was come; yet even at
this supreme moment he felt as cool as though he
were going to step out of the chamber next moment
and go about his usual business.</p>

<p>For a full minute the Tsar and Boris faced each
other without a spoken word from either&mdash;Peter,
with drawn sword half raised to strike, his breast
heaving, his breath drawn in with hissings, his face
working with evil passion, his eyes ablaze, and the
infinite generosity and manhood of his nature struggling
beneath the passion that had so long suffocated
and cramped it; Boris, calm and cool, thinking, like
a good Russian, of his soul, but thinking also of
Nancy, who was so soon to be deprived of a friend
as tender and true as the best.</p>

<p>At length the Tsar's arm fell to his side and he
tossed his sword upon the table.</p>

<p>"Be it so," he said; and then, "There is not another
in all Russia for whose sake that sword should have
been held back. Boris Ivanitch, I remind myself of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
your good service&mdash;we have been friends and brothers&mdash;you
have even saved my life at the risk of your
own. For these reasons I forbear to strike, as you
deserve. But you have disobeyed me&mdash;" here the
Tsar's face worked once more, and he was silent for a
moment. Then he continued, "You have disobeyed
me; you can serve me no longer, you are no servant
of mine from this hour. Thus I tear you from my
heart for ever. Give me your sword." Peter tore the
epaulets from his shoulders, and took Boris's sword,
laying it beside his own upon the table. "Now go
from my sight; I will never see you more. I can
never forget your disobedience; it is for me the
unpardonable thing. Away&mdash;out of my sight!"</p>

<p>Boris had been prepared for death, but he had
not expected this&mdash;disgrace and banishment from the
face of his beloved master; for at the Tsar's words
Boris had felt all his old love come swelling into his
heart.</p>

<p>The poor hunter burst into tears and seized the
Tsar's hand to kiss it ere he left his presence for ever.</p>

<p>But the Tsar repelled him. "Go," he said sternly&mdash;"out
of my sight; you sicken me with your woman's
ways; I am not to be softened by hand-kissing and
crying&mdash;go!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus befell the first and only quarrel between the
bear-hunter and his much-loved master, and the pair
were destined, in consequence of it, to be parted for
many a long year.</p>

<p>Boris realized at once that he must leave Moscow.
There was little object and much danger in remaining
in the capital. Once in disgrace with the Tsar, there
was no certainty but that the madness of Peter might
cause him to treat Boris with scant ceremony should
he meet the hunter in the streets or elsewhere.
Whither, then, should he go?</p>

<p>Boris went to his apartment, and, with aching
head and dazed intelligence, sat down to think out
the problem. Why not return to Dubinka? That
was his first idea; but he put it from him at once.
Dubinka was too far away from Moscow; for Boris
could not allow himself to banish entirely the hope
that the Tsar might yet forgive him when these
evil days had passed and all was forgotten. Besides,
there was Nancy. He could never bear to live so far
away from her home; how should he ever do without
her love, now that he had come to realize that it was,
if not all in all to him, at least a large proportion of
his all?</p>

<p>Boris ended his cogitations, which resulted in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
nothing, by setting out to walk to the Drurys' house,
to inform them of the melancholy turn which his
affairs had taken, and to ask their advice. No one
was at home excepting Nancy, and to her Boris then
and there confided his tale.</p>

<p>Nancy's face flushed as her friend told of how he
had refused to obey the Tsar's bidding, of his disgrace,
and of the loss of military rank and the Tsar's service.
To the surprise of Boris the girl burst into tears and
kissed the torn places upon his tunic where the Tsar
had violently removed the epaulets. "I thank God
you did what you did," she cried, "for, O Boris! I
could never have loved you quite so well again if
you had executed those poor men!"</p>

<p>Then Boris felt a great flood of comfort and encouragement
come welling into his heart, and he went
on to tell Nancy, with recovered spirits, of his determination
to leave Moscow, and his reasons for taking
the step.</p>

<p>Nancy grew very pale as he spoke of this, and
when he was silent she, too, said no word for some
little space. Then she placed her little hand in his
big one and said,&mdash;</p>

<p>"If you leave Moscow, I shall go with you."</p>

<p>"Where to, Nancy? I am not going for one day,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
said obtuse Boris, playing with the little hand in his,
and speaking sadly enough.</p>

<p>"Anywhere&mdash;I care not whither; but wherever
you go, my Boris, I shall go too." Nancy smiled
through her tears. "Won't you take me&mdash;won't you
have me, Boris?" she said.</p>

<p>Then the hunter understood what the child wished
to convey to his dense mind, and all his soul came
rushing to his lips as he gathered her to his breast and
said a thousand incoherent and tender and ridiculous
things. For it had not dawned upon Boris that she
was no longer a child, but a very beautiful and tender
maiden of seventeen; and that it was now possible,
if nothing untoward prevented it, to carry her away
with him, even as she had, in her innocent candour,
suggested, to be his lifelong companion and helpmate.</p>

<p>So Boris and Nancy passed a happy hour together,
and all things miserable and unfortunate were forgotten
in the new light which was thus shed upon the
prospect. How different now seemed the idea of
leaving Moscow! How could Boris have been so
blind? Fate could not have been kinder. The Tsar
would have forgiven him long before he should grow
tired of indolent married life and wish to return to
service and the imperial favour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>When Colonel and Mrs. Drury returned home and
heard the story of Boris, and Nancy's declaration that
she would not suffer him to go alone into exile (which
in no wise surprised them), they had a new plan
to propose. They possessed a country house, set in
its own corner of the forest, some twenty miles from
Moscow. Why should not the whole party retire to
Karapselka for a while? The priest of the village
could perform the marriage ceremony as well as the
high ecclesiastics of Moscow; and probably Boris
would prefer to have a quiet wedding, in order to
escape observation. After the ceremony Nancy and
her husband could take up their abode permanently
at Karapselka, and there await the dawn of happier
days, while the old people returned to Moscow, where
they would at all times be within easy reach of their
daughter. Boris would find plenty of congenial occupation
among the bears and wolves in the forest.</p>

<p>This plan was hailed with joy by all concerned;
and it need only be added that Nancy and Boris were
duly married, and took up their abode at Karapselka,
as the parents of the bride had suggested and as destiny
decreed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />

NANCY AND THE BIG BEAR.</h2>


<p>There was, as Colonel Drury had promised,
plenty for Boris to do at Karapselka; so
much so, indeed, that the hunter scarcely was aware
of the flight of time, so happily did the days and the
weeks and the months come and go. Nancy was the
sweetest of young wives, and in her company Boris
soon forgot his disgrace, and the sorrow and regret
which the quarrel with the Tsar still caused him
whenever he recalled it. Away from drills and service
and the countless engagements and amusements
of city life, the bear-hunter soon recovered all his old
passion for the life of the forest. From morn till
night he was afoot, tracking, hunting upon his trusty
snow-shoes, stalking capercailzie or blackcock among
the rime-embroidered pine trees, and revelling in the
free and wholesome air of his oldest friend, the forest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Nancy often accompanied him on his excursions, when
the distance was not too great; and the evenings
passed as happily as mutually agreeable society could
make them.</p>

<p>During these months and even years of peaceful
life at Karapselka, Boris had many adventures with
those animals which had furnished him his original
title, as well as with wolves. In these adventures he
found that his old skill in the chase was in no wise
diminished, nor his nerve shaken, nor his strength
and activity abated; he was still the bear-hunter all
over. Sometimes it appeared to him that all his
military career and his many adventures by land and
sea were nothing more than a dream, and that he
was back in Dubinka chasing the wild animals as a
paid employé of his liege lord, the owner of the land
and village in which he lived. But a word from
Nancy, or a look into her sweet face, soon put matters
into shape, and he knew himself for what he
was&mdash;a once-favoured servant and soldier of the Tsar,
now living under a cloud; a state of affairs which
should have made him very miserable, whereas there
was no denying the fact that he was nothing of the
sort, but, on the contrary, exceedingly well content
with his present lot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, when they had been married for the
better part of a year, Boris and Nancy met with an
adventure which might have had fatal consequences
for both of them.</p>

<p>Boris had allowed his wife to accompany him, as
he often did, into the woods, driving in their comfortable
kibitka, or covered sledge, to a point at a distance
of a few miles from the house, and thence proceeding
on snow-shoes for a mile or two further in pursuit of
hares or foxes, or perhaps with an eye to a partridge
or two to replenish the larder.</p>

<p>The day was magnificent&mdash;one of those glorious
February days when the sun is bright but not warm,
and the air rare and invigorating; when every pine
is a marvel of subtile filigree-work in silver rime, and
the snow beneath one's feet is dazzling with innumerable
ice-gems, and has so hard a crust upon it that it
will bear the weight of a man.</p>

<p>Nancy and her husband had enjoyed their drive,
and were now drinking in the intoxicating fresh
forest air as they slid easily along upon their snow-shoes,
Nancy having by this time become quite an
expert in this graceful fashion of getting over the
ground.</p>

<p>The larder at Karapselka happened to be empty at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
this time, for there was no system of obliging bakers
and butchers to call for orders in that out-of-the-way
spot, nor indeed in Moscow either in those days;
and Boris was intent upon whistling up tree-partridges,
to provide food for the establishment at home.
Three of these beautiful birds had come swooping up
in response to his call, but had swerved and settled
a hundred paces to the left. Boris immediately and
cautiously followed them, in hope of getting a shot
at the birds before they should take fright. On crept
Boris, Nancy cautiously following him at a distance.</p>

<p>Suddenly, to the surprise and alarm of Nancy, and
certainly no less of himself, Boris disappeared in a
cloud of snow&mdash;disappeared as completely as though
the earth had opened and swallowed him whole.</p>

<p>For a moment Nancy stopped short in consternation
and uncertainty, so sudden had been the disappearance
of her lord, when, to her still greater amazement and
horror, there came from the spot where her husband
had disappeared first terrific roars and growlings, together
with much upheaving of snow and pine boughs,
and next the ponderous figure of a large bear. Boris
had fallen into a <i>berloga</i>, which is Russian for the
den which a bear makes for himself during his hibernating
period, and in which he remains more or less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
fast asleep from November until the thawing of the
snow in March or April.</p>

<p>This was the first occasion upon which Nancy had
seen a live bear at close quarters; and though she
was as courageous a little person as you will meet
in a day's march, yet the unexpected sight filled
her with terror, which was largely increased when
the great brute caught sight of her, and with renewed
roarings made straight for the very spot where she
stood helpless and motionless.</p>

<p>What had happened is easily explained and in a few
words. Boris had stepped upon the top of a berloga,
the roof of which immediately gave way beneath
his weight, precipitating him upon the top of the
sleeping tenant. The bear was not so far gone in
somnolence but that the sudden descent upon his
person of so heavy an individual as Boris not only
awoke but irritated him exceedingly. Boris, finding
himself upon the bear's back at the bottom of Bruin's
own premises, felt quite at home; indeed, he was
never more so than when in the company of a bear.
He felt about for his knife, but found to his annoyance
that he had left it at home. His axe was at his
side, but there was no room to use it except by getting
off the brute's back and allowing it to scramble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
out of the den, when he might get a stroke at it as it
went, wounding it sufficiently to prevent its escape,
and finishing the business as soon as he could climb
out also.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the bear was doing its utmost to rid
itself of the incubus on its back. It heaved itself
up and wriggled, and at last tried to bolt through
the aperture which the new arrival had made in the
roof of the den. By this move it rid itself of Boris,
who slid off backwards, but could not recover himself
in time to aim the blow at Bruin's hind-quarter
which he had intended to deal it.</p>

<p>By the time Boris was upon his feet the bear had
disappeared, and it only then struck Boris that Nancy
was outside, and might be in danger of receiving injury
from the frightened and angry creature. Full
of this fear Boris darted upwards in order to follow
the bear and see to Nancy's safety. But the roof
gave way as he attempted to climb out, and he fell
backwards a second time to the bottom of the berloga.
At the second attempt Boris was more successful, and
reached the surface in safety.</p>

<p>But when he did so he saw a sight which filled
him with fear and horror, for the huge brute was in
full pursuit of his young wife, who fled before it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
upon her snow-shoes, uttering cries of alarm and
calling on Boris to help her.</p>

<p>"Bear round this way to me&mdash;to me, Nancy!"
shouted the poor hunter in agony, starting to run
after the pair in desperate dread.</p>

<p>His snow-shoes had been broken in his tumble into
the bear's den, so that he was now on foot and trusting
to the hard crust of the snow to support him.
The animal turned at the sound of his voice, and for
a moment seemed to pause, as though doubtful upon
which of the two enemies to wreak its passion; then
it turned again and resumed its pursuit of poor
Nancy. Boris saw with anguish that whenever
Nancy endeavoured to edge round in order to come
towards him, her pursuer seemed to comprehend her
design, and prevented it by cutting the corner to meet
her.</p>

<p>Then Boris thought in his agony of mind of another
plan. Nancy was gliding beautifully on her
light shoes, and could easily keep her lead of the
bear so long as her breath held out; while he, run
as fast as he might, could scarcely keep up with the
chase, without shoes to help him along. It was plain
that at this rate he would never overtake bear or
wife, and could thus do nothing to assist poor Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make for the sledge, Nancy," he shouted; "go
straight along our old tracks&mdash;'tis but a short half-mile
away!"</p>

<p>Nancy heard and understood, and went straight on,
looking neither to the right hand nor to the left, but
only straining every nerve to gain upon the brute
behind her, so as to reach the sledge sufficiently well
ahead of him to allow time to unfasten the horse,
which was tied to a tree.</p>

<p>On rushed Nancy, and on came the bear behind
her, she gaining slowly but steadily; and after them
came panting Boris, with difficulty holding his own,
for all that he was a good runner and in fair condition,
for at every third or fourth step the treacherous
snow surface gave way and plunged his foot and leg
deep in the powdery ice-covered stuff.</p>

<p>And now the sledge came into view, and a glad
sight it was for more than one of the party. Nancy
took heart at seeing it, and made a renewed effort to
gain a yard or two, reaching the horse's head&mdash;the
horse struggling and tugging for terror of the bear
the while&mdash;with a lead of thirty good yards. Deftly
she untied the noose and freed the snorting, terrified
animal, and as deftly she threw her body across the
side of the sledge, and the horse, feeling himself free,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
dashed with it homewards. Then she slipped into
the seat, just at the very moment that Bruin arrived
upon the spot to find his bird flown.</p>

<p>"Bravo, bravo, my Nancy!" shouted Boris, as he
watched with unspeakable relief and joy how the
swift little sledge bore her instantly out of danger.&mdash;"Now,
Mishka," he added, "come back and settle
accounts with me; you won't catch that bird, she's
flown."</p>

<p>The bear, who was still standing and watching the
sledge as it glided away from him, seemed to hear
and comprehend the invitation of Boris. It turned
sharp round upon hearing his voice, and with a loud
roar accepted the challenge thrown out to it. It
looked very large, and certainly a terrific object, as it
bore down upon Boris, half mad with fury that Nancy
should have escaped its wrath, and roaring aloud as it
came.</p>

<p>But the hunter cared nothing for its roarings, nor
yet for the ferocity of its appearance, though such
fury as it had shown was somewhat rare in a bear
which is suddenly awaked from its winter sleep. He
stood very calmly, axe in hand, and awaited the onslaught.</p>

<p>When the bear came close up it raised itself upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
its hind-legs, whereupon Boris aimed a terrific blow
with his axe at the head of the brute. The axe was
sharp and the aim was true, and the iron crashed
through Bruin's head with so mighty a shock that in
an instant this monster, who had been so terrible but
a moment since, was more harmless than the smallest
creature that flies and stings.</p>

<p>Then Boris looked, and perceived that his wife had
returned from the sledge and was at his elbow with
the gun, which she had found and brought in case he
should require help in his dealings with the bear.
She was pale with her fright and panting with her
run, and Boris took her very tenderly in his arms and
bore her back to the sledge, praising and encouraging
her. And it so fell out that on this very night was
born their little daughter Katie, of whom I shall have
something presently to tell.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />

A WOLF-MAIDEN.</h2>


<p>Happy as she had been before, Nancy was now
in the seventh heaven of content. There
was no more dulness and waiting for her now, when
Boris had set forth for a full day's hunting in the
forest and left her to look after household matters
at home. That little baby was companion and
occupation and amusement to her, all in one tiny
person, and the days passed right joyously at Karapselka.</p>

<p>When spring came, and the frost and snow had
disappeared from the woods, Nancy loved to take her
little companion in the tiny hand-cart and pass a
pleasant hour or two wandering beneath the waving
pine trees, enjoying the fine air, and listening to
the thousand and one sounds of awakening forest life.
The little birds populating the tree-tops were noisy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
at this time of year, and there were the crooning of
the amorous blackcock to listen for, and the tok-tok
of the gluhar, or capercailzie, while in the distance
might always be heard the screaming of cranes in
some damp corner of the woods, as they kept up their
constant sentry-cry. There was plenty both to see
and hear in these glorious woods&mdash;there always is
for those who have eyes and ears, and know how to
employ them to advantage&mdash;and Nancy was never
weary of strolling with her baby asleep in her cart
into the delightful glades which lay within easy reach
of her home.</p>

<p>Since her adventure with the bear, Boris had insisted
that she should go armed, and had presented
her with a neat hunting-knife, without which she was
never, he said, to stir from home, were it but for a
hundred paces into the forest and back again. So
Nancy went armed, though she declared she would be
far too frightened to use her dagger if she were to
encounter a second bear anything like the first. But
Boris explained carefully how the knife should be
used in emergency, and how not to use it, of which
there appeared to be a great many ways.</p>

<p>One day, while out strolling as usual in the forest,
Nancy suddenly caught sight of two small animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
whose aspect was quite unfamiliar to her, which was
odd, for she was as well acquainted with the life of
the forest by this time as any Russian peasant-woman
who had lived in it from childhood. The little
creatures were somewhat like puppies, with a suggestion
of fox, and when Nancy ran after them they
scuttled away with comical little barks.</p>

<p>Nancy mentioned this matter to Boris on his return
from hunting.</p>

<p>"What colour were they?" Boris asked.</p>

<p>Nancy said they were of a yellowish gray.</p>

<p>"They were young wolves, then," said Boris; "and
if you see them again, catch one for me if you can&mdash;I
long to possess a tame wolf-cub; but have your
knife handy in case of the mother interfering."</p>

<p>It so fell out that a few days after this conversation
Nancy did see these same little creatures again,
four of them together; whereupon, mindful of her
husband's great wish to possess one, she left the baby
asleep in its hand-cart and gave chase. The wolflings
scampered bravely, and led her up and down and
about in every direction, until Nancy bethought herself
that she was getting winded, and besides that she
might easily get confused, if she went further, as to
the position in which she had left her precious little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
Katie. So she gave up the hunt, and returned towards
the place whence she started.</p>

<p>Then she realized how just had been her fears, for
it was with difficulty that she succeeded at last in
retracing her steps to the place where the hand-cart
had been left. To her surprise and alarm she saw
that the cart lay over upon its side; and hastening
towards it she perceived, to her unspeakable consternation
and horror, that it was empty.</p>

<p>Poor Nancy was not the person to sit down and do
nothing in an emergency; but the horror of the discovery
she had just made bereft her for some few
moments of the power of action as well as of thought.
Her mind instantly flew back to the words of Boris
telling her to beware of the mother-wolf, and for
several minutes these words danced in her brain. The
mother-wolf, it was the mother-wolf! it had taken
her darling child in order to feed those detestable little
gray scuttling things which she had chased through
the trees! While she had been senselessly hunting
the cubs, the mother-wolf&mdash;some lean-looking, gray,
skulking brute&mdash;had crept secretly up and carried
away her Katie, her darling baby.</p>

<p>In another moment Nancy had drawn her sharp
little dagger, and with shriek upon shriek had rushed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
wildly into the forest and disappeared among the
pines, whither she knew not, but full of a wild determination
to find that gray thief and force her to
deliver up to her the priceless thing she had stolen.</p>

<p>When Boris returned home late in the afternoon
he was somewhat surprised to find that Nancy was
not at home. She and the baby had gone for a stroll
in the woods, the old servant explained, and had not
been home to dinner.</p>

<p>"God grant the <i>lieshui</i> [wood-spirits] have not got
hold of them, or done them some injury!" the old
fellow concluded, sighing deeply. "The forest is a
terrible place, and for my part I have always warned
the barina."</p>

<p>Boris did not stay to exchange words with his
faithful old serf, but taking a horse from the stable
galloped off as fast as he could into the forest, shouting
Nancy's name in every direction. Up and down,
and through and through every glade and pathway,
wherever there was room for the horse to pass, Boris
rode; and ever as he rode he shouted Nancy's name,
until his voice grew hoarse, and the cob waxed weary,
and the light began to wane, and still he neither
found trace nor heard sound of his lost wife and
child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Still he rode on and on, and would have ridden all
night rather than return home to misery and uncertainty;
but when he was upwards of twelve miles
from the house, and his heart was despairing and his
spirit mad within him, he heard at length a faint
reply to his calling. Lashing up his tired horse he
dashed on, and presently, to his infinite joy and relief,
he came upon Nancy sitting worn and utterly fagged
out beneath a tree, crying bitterly, and nursing in her
arms a portion of her baby's frock which she had
picked up in the forest.</p>

<p>For many minutes poor Nancy could do no more
than cling to her husband's broad breast, and sob and
weep as though her very heart were melted within
her for sorrow. At last she held up the tiny torn
dress, and murmured, "The mother-wolf," and then
betook herself once more to her bitter crying.</p>

<p>Boris realized at once what had happened&mdash;realized
also that he had arrived far too late to do any good;
for the wolf, even if it had not at once eaten the poor
baby but carried it away to feast upon at leisure,
must now be far away beyond the reach of pursuit.
In his great joy and thankfulness to have found
Nancy safe, Boris did not feel in all its poignancy, in
these first moments, that grief for the child which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
was destined to suffer acutely afterwards. His chief
thought was for Nancy; she must be got home and
at once, that was the most important duty of the
moment. As for the baby, it was gone beyond
recall, and would assuredly never be seen again by
mortal eye.</p>

<p>"Come, Nancy," he said, when he had comforted
and petted his poor stricken wife, "let me get you
home, and then I will scour the forest on a fresh
horse. You need food and rest. If our Katie is
alive, I shall not cease searching till she is found; if
not, I shall not rest until I have killed every wolf
within fifty miles of the house!"</p>

<p>But Nancy would not hear of it. "Oh no, no,"
she cried, "I shall never go home till we have found
our darling. She is alive, I am sure of it. See, there
is no blood on the frock; the wolf has not hurt her.
It stole her away because I was wicked to chase her
little ones. It is wrong to catch the wild animals of
God's forest and enslave them. We ought to have
known it, Boris."</p>

<p>The frock had no stain of blood, that was true
enough; and the circumstance gave Boris some slight
hope that it might be as the stricken mother had
suggested, though the chances were much against it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
Boris had heard often enough stories of how wolves
had taken and befriended babies, allowing them to
grow up with the cubs. His own experience of the
ferocity and greed of these animals, however, had
always led him to laugh at such tales as old women's
yarns, unworthy of a moment's serious consideration.
Nancy had heard of them too, that was evident, and
was now leaning upon the hope that in poor little
Katie's disappearance was living evidence of their
truth.</p>

<p>No persuasions would induce the sorrowing mother,
therefore, to give up the search. All night long
Boris walked beside the horse, supporting his weary
little wife, who could scarcely sit in the saddle for
weakness and fatigue; and not until the horse was
unable to go further would she consent to pause in
the work of quartering the ground in every direction,
and riding through every clump of cover, in case the
beloved object of her search should have been concealed
in it.</p>

<p>When morning came, and the sun rose warm and
bright over the aspen bushes, Boris found a place
where the horse could obtain a meal of coarse grass,
and where Nancy, upon a soft couch of heather, could
lie down and take the rest she so greatly required.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
He was lucky enough to find and kill a hare, and
with the help of a fire of sticks, which no man in
Russia was better able to kindle than he, an excellent
improvised breakfast was soon prepared. Afterwards,
Nancy slept for several hours while Boris watched,
listening intently the while in the hope of hearing the
sound of a wolf-howl, which might possibly indicate
the whereabouts of the thief. But the hours passed,
and there was nothing to guide him to take one
direction more than another, and poor Boris knew
well enough that he had set himself a hopeless task;
nevertheless, for Nancy's sake, he agreed to continue
the search for the rest of that day, and the forest
was hunted as it had never been hunted before, until
his feet ached with walking, and Nancy was but
half-conscious for sheer weariness. Then Boris took
the law into his own hands and directed the horse
for home, and the weary trio reached Karapselka
as the shadows of night fell upon the forest behind
them.</p>

<p>The next morning a peasant came early and inquired
for the barin. Boris, who was about to set
out once more upon his hopeless search, received the
man unwillingly, as one who is in a hurry and cannot
stop to discuss trifles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well?" he said; "quick, what is it?"</p>

<p>The man scratched his head for inspiration, then
he cleared his throat and began the business upon
which he had come. He had been in the forest yesterday,
he said, collecting firewood. The winters were
cold, he proceeded, and the poor peasants must spend
a good deal of their time during summer in laying up
a store of fuel for the winter. But it was God's will
that the peasants should be always poor.</p>

<p>"Get to the point," said Boris impatiently, "or I
must go without hearing it."</p>

<p>That would be a pity, the man continued, for he
believed that when the barin heard what he had to
tell, the barin would give him a <i>nachaiok</i> (tea-money)
for the news. He had been in the forest collecting
wood, he repeated, when suddenly he saw a sight
which filled him with fear&mdash;nothing less than a great
she-wolf with a whole litter of young ones following
at her heels. The man had at once thought to himself,
"Here now is a chance of a nachaiok from Boris
Ivanitch, who is a great hunter, and will love to hear
of a family of wolves close at hand." But the
moment after, said the peasant, he saw something
which quite altered the aspect of the affair. When
the wolf saw him, she had stopped and picked up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
from the ground where it lay close to her a small
creature something like a human child, and which
cried like one, but which was of course one of the
lieshui, or wood-spirits, which often enough take the
form of babe or old man. The she-wolf took up the
creature in its mouth and trotted away with it into
the forest. "Oho," the man had thought, "still more
shall I earn a nachaiok from Boris Ivanitch; for now
I must warn him that if he meets with this particular
she-wolf and her brats he must give them a wide
berth and be sure not to shoot or injure them, for
this wolf is the handmaid of the lieshui, and woe to
him who interferes with the favoured creatures of
those touchy and tricksy spirits, for they would
assuredly lure him to his destruction when next he
ventured deep into the heart of the forest."</p>

<p>Boris hastily bade the man follow him and point
out the exact spot where he had seen this wonderful
sight. The peasant showed a place within a short
distance of the house, and added that the wolf family
had passed at sunset on the previous evening.</p>

<p>Here then was joyous news for Nancy; her babe
had been alive and well some thirty-six hours after
its disappearance, and had actually been seen within
call of its own home, while its distracted parents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
had scoured the woods for a score of miles in every
direction, little dreaming that the child was left far
behind.</p>

<p>Nancy received the news calmly, but with the
intensest joy and gratitude. "I was sure our darling
was alive," she said; "but oh, Boris, if only it were
winter and we could track the thief down! What
are we to do, and how are we to find the child before
the she-wolf carries her far away, or changes her
mind and devours her?" And Nancy wailed aloud
in her helplessness and misery.</p>

<p>There was nothing to be done but to search the
forest daily, taking care to do nothing and permit
nothing to be done in the village to frighten the
wolves, and scare them away far into the depths of
the forest, where there would be no hope of ever
finding them again. Accordingly no day went by
but was spent by Boris and his ever-hopeful but
distracted wife in quartering the woods far and near,
the pair going softly and speaking seldom, and that
in whispers, for fear of scaring the wolves away.</p>

<p>But the days passed, and the weeks also, and a
month came, and slowly there crept over their souls
the certainty that their labour would be in vain, and
that they had seen the last of their beloved child. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
they would never entirely lose hope, and day by day
they continued their wearisome tramping, sometimes
going afoot, sometimes riding when their feet grew
sore with the constant walking. Another fortnight
went by, and it was now high summer, and still they
were childless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />

A NOTABLE DAY AMONG THE WOLVES.</h2>


<p>Then, at length, when their bodies were wearied
with the fatigue of constant tramping, and
their souls worn out with disappointment, and their
hearts sick with hope deferred, there came a day of
great joy for Boris and Nancy.</p>

<p>It befell on this wise. They were out, as usual,
quartering the forest, and hunting every clump of
birch cover and grove of young fir trees, Boris being
in front, and Nancy behind on the left, when a cry
from his wife caused the hunter to start and look
round, fingering his axe, for he knew not what might
befall in these dark depths of the forest. Nancy
repeated her cry and rushed forwards; and Boris
knew at once that it was no cry of terror, but of
ecstasy and joy. He too sprang forward to rejoin
Nancy, and a wonderful sight met his eye.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span></p>

<p>There, close before them in an open space between
the trees, a huge she-wolf was trotting across
the glade, followed by her six cubs, and chasing after
the tail of the procession was a tiny human child,
hurrying along as fast as it could make way on
hands and knees, losing ground, however, rapidly,
and crying because it could not keep up with the
rest.</p>

<p>With swift inarticulate cries of great joy Nancy
rushed open-armed in pursuit, and Boris was not far
behind.</p>

<p>The old wolf stopped once, and turned and snarled
savagely at Nancy; but its heart failed, and it quickly
disappeared among the trees, followed by its four-legged
cubs, leaving the little foster-child. Her the
true mother, frantic with love and happiness, caught
quickly up and hid close in her bosom, bending over
it and calling it every sweet name in the English
language, and in the Russian also, and cooing and
talking nonsense to it.</p>

<p>But the child snapped, and scratched, and growled,
and struggled, and fought, as though it were no
human child but a very wolf born and bred. So
fiercely did it fight and kick out for its freedom that
Nancy was obliged presently to set it down, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
instantly made off on hands and knees in the direction
taken by its companions.</p>

<p>Boris fairly roared with laughter in the exuberance
of his delight to see the child alive and well; and
Nancy in her joy could do nothing wiser than laugh
also, as they both walked quickly after the little
crawling thing, easily keeping up with it, though it
went far quicker than they would have believed possible.
This time the father picked up the wild tiny
creature, and well he got himself scratched for his
pains, of which he took no heed whatever. Presently
the poor babe, finding that her captor had no intention
of hurting her, lay quiescent in his arms, and
after a while fell asleep, tired of crying and fighting,
and doubtless feeling very comfortable.</p>

<p>Nancy meanwhile walked beside her husband, feeling
no ground beneath her feet. All her weariness
and her heart-soreness had vanished entirely, and the
lines of care which had set themselves upon her face,
and caused her to look old and worn in the May-time
of her life, had vanished also. She danced and sang
as she went, and in all that forestful of gay singers
there was none that was so happy as she. And at
home, what though the little savage bit and snarled
and refused to be fed or washed, and for many hours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
thought of nothing but how to escape back into the
woods&mdash;why, a mother's love and care would soon recover
it to herself, she said, and she could well afford
to wait for a few days longer for her full happiness,
she who had waited so long and wearily in tears and
sorrow!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the faithful Nancy had not to
wait very long before matters began to mend. The
little wolf-girl soon found that she was well off, and
that no one wished to do her hurt. After this it was
merely a matter of patience, for the little one became
more human, and showed less of the wolf every hour,
until, at the end of a week, she permitted herself to
be washed and dressed and fed and petted with no
more opposition than is generally shown by people of
the age of four or five months! What opposition she
did make to anything she disapproved of was perhaps
more savage than that of most babies; but there the
difference ended.</p>

<p>One peculiarity remained for many a day&mdash;an intense
love of the woods and of the open air generally,
as well as a marked taste for scuttling about on hands
and knees, which she managed to do at a very great
speed considering her size. Nancy was wont to declare
that for neither of these characteristics was she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
indebted to her sojourn among the wolves, but that
she simply inherited both her love of the forest as
well as her nimbleness from her father. I who write
these lines am inclined to believe that her wolfish
infancy is a sufficiently good reason for both.</p>

<p>Thus ended happily the most terrible experience
that a devoted father and mother could pass through;
and if the child was loved before, she was ten times
as dear to both parents after her almost miraculous
recovery from the very jaws of death. Boris
declared that he could never kill another she-wolf
unless it were to save his own or another life; and
this resolution, I may add, he kept until his dying
day.</p>

<p>Thus the months and the years went by at Karapselka
in peace and happiness, with but an occasional
adventure to break the monotony of such an existence.
Boris was perfectly happy; but for all that he was
conscious from time to time of a feeling of regret
for his old days of activity in the Tsar's service,
and of honour fairly won and unfairly lost, and he
felt that this fleeting sensation might at any moment
strengthen into an irresistible desire and longing
to be up and about once more among his fellow-men.
This sort of life was all very well for a time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
but, after all, it was an inglorious sort of existence,
and Boris knew that even his devotion to Nancy and
her babies&mdash;for she had two now&mdash;would not suffice
to keep him at Karapselka very much longer, especially
if anything should happen to reawaken his old
spirit of enterprise, or to bring him again within the
magic of the Tsar's presence and favour. Of this last
Boris had but little hope, for Peter's displeasure had
been too deep for forgiveness; but there were rumours
of war with Sweden, which Colonel Drury, who
brought the news, said would be a long and terrible
struggle if the threatenings came to anything; and
Boris in his wanderings through the forest continually
found himself turning over in his mind the idea that
if war broke out with Sweden he must have a share
in the business, ay, even if he enlisted as a soldier of
the lowest rank to do it. Had not the Tsar himself
started at the very foot of the ladder? then why not
he? He was barely twenty-eight; there was plenty
of time to carve himself out new honour and a new
career with the sword. And if, <i>if</i> he were so fortunate
as to gain the notice of the Tsar, by some feat
of arms, for instance, or some act of bravery on the
battle-field&mdash;and the Tsar's eye saw everything, so that
it would not escape his notice&mdash;who knows? As a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
new man his beloved master might take him into
new favour.</p>

<p>Occupied with these thoughts, Boris walked one
winter day through the forest, looking for the tracks
of any beast that should have had the misfortune to
pass where he too wandered. Suddenly the hunter
was pulled up in his reflections, as also in his stride,
by a largish footprint in the snow. He knew it at
once for what it was&mdash;a wolf's; but the experienced
eye of Boris knew also at a glance what a less expert
woodcraftsman would not have known&mdash;namely, that
here had passed not one wolf but several, for wolves
prefer to tread in one another's tracks, in order to
save themselves the trouble of plunging into the snow
and out again.</p>

<p>Boris examined the track, and judged that there
must have been five or six wolves, at least, travelling
in a procession, and also that they must have passed
this spot but a very short while ago, for the loose
snow-powder still sifted into the holes left by the
animals' feet.</p>

<p>The sporting instincts of Boris never required much
to arouse them when dormant, and in a moment Boris
had forgotten all about the possible Swedish war, and
enlistment, and everything else, excepting the fact<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
that here was a family of wolves, and here was he,
the hunter, and that the sooner he followed up and
engaged those wolves the greater would be his happiness.
So away went Boris upon the trail, flying like
the wind upon his light Archangel snow-shoes, which
are the best in the world, and the use of which Boris
understood perhaps better than any man in all Russia.</p>

<p>Before he had gone very far the hunter noticed
that the track of a man, without snow-shoes, came
into that of the wolves, cross-wise&mdash;that is, the
wolves had come upon the track of this man, and
had turned aside to follow it. "Hungry wolves,"
said Boris to himself; "going to run in the man's
tracks&mdash;perhaps to attack him if they get a good
chance!" Accordingly Boris hastened on, for he
scented fun in this, and his life of late had been
terribly lacking in incident.</p>

<p>The tracks meandered about in the most curious
way, now heading in one direction, now in another,
and at last travelling round in a complete circle and
recrossing a point where they had passed before; and
wherever the man went the wolves had gone also.
"Lost his way," thought Boris. "How frightened the
poor fellow must have been when he crossed his own
track and saw there were wolves after him!" Then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
the hunter could see that after crossing the old
tracks the wanderer had greatly accelerated his pace.
"Frightened," thought Boris; "and small wonder."</p>

<p>Soon there was audible at no great distance a noise
of yelpings, such as wolves make when they grow excited
in the pursuit of their prey; and Boris rightly
concluded that these wolves were very hungry, and
not likely to hold back from attacking a single man,
unless he should be provided with fire-arms. He had
better make all speed, or the matter might end unpleasantly
for one of the members of the hunt.</p>

<p>And presently Boris ran suddenly into a stirring
sight. There, before him, with his back to a tree,
stood a big, kaftaned man, armed with a dagger, keeping
at bay as best he could a band of seven wolves,
who, to judge by their demeanour, had every intention
of pulling him down. If there was one thing in
all the world that Boris would have chosen, it was
such an enterprise as this. His very soul was athirst
for a good slashing fight with man or beast&mdash;it was
four or five years since he had engaged in a real
scrimmage against odds, such as this promised to
be; so Boris flourished his axe and rushed into the
thick of it with a shout of real exultation. Right
and left he slashed, and right and left again, and two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
wolf-lives had gone out in a moment, while two other
gray bleeding creatures crawled yelping and snarling
away to die in hiding. Another rush in, and the foe
would wait no longer, but turned, and in an instant
were skulking away into the forest.</p>

<p>Then for the first time Boris looked up at the man
whom he had saved from the unpleasant position of a
minute or two ago, and as he raised his eyes the axe
fell from his hand, and his heart gave a great bound
of surprise and joy, and then stood still.</p>

<p>Of all the men in the world least likely to be met
with in this place, of all men in the world that Boris
loved the dearest and honoured the most, and most
ardently longed to see and to speak to, it was he&mdash;the
Tsar&mdash;Peter!</p>

<p>For a full minute neither spoke. The heart of
Boris was too full for words, and his tongue refused
to utter sound of any sort. When at length the
silence was broken, it was the Tsar who spoke, and his
voice seemed to Boris unlike the old boisterous voice
of three years ago; it was quieter and a little tremulous.</p>

<p>"Boris," said the Tsar, "this cannot be accident;
we are but puppets in the hands of a mightier Power
which overrides our puny will and laughs at our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
dispositions. This is the fourth time, I account it, that
you have directly or indirectly stood between me and
death; how can I possibly continue to hold aloof
from you, my brother?"</p>

<p>At these words all the old love and devotion that
Boris had felt for his master completely overcame
him, and he fairly flung himself at Peter's knees and
hugged them, weeping.</p>

<p>"No, no; get you up, my Bear-eater," said the
Tsar, raising him. "It appears to me that we were
both somewhat wrong upon a memorable occasion; I
have since thought so more than once. And having
said this much, I will neither say nor hear another
word in respect of those events, which are done with
and lie buried in the past. As concerning the present,
my Boris, what brought you so miraculously here at
the precise moment when you of all men were the
most needed? I had you in my mind as you appeared,
and had but that instant bethought me that
I would you were with me as of old; and at that
same instant you came."</p>

<p>Then Boris, his heart bursting with great joy,
began to tell the Tsar how that his house was but
a few miles away, and that in this same house he and
Nancy had dwelt for the last three years. Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
knew nothing of all this, for the name of Boris was
never breathed at court since the day of his disgrace,
seeing that the Tsar himself never spoke it. Then
Peter in his turn explained how he had wandered
from his suite in pursuit of a roebuck, but had lost
his way; and how he had not thought of danger until
he found himself pursued by wolves and armed with
but a knife. And both thanked God that Boris and
his axe had chanced to wander in the same direction.</p>

<p>Then the pair got to talking of old days and their
many adventures together as they walked towards
the house; and the Tsar graciously said that now he
had found him again, he could only wonder how
he had contrived to do without his faithful bear-eater
so long, and would Boris, forgetting all that
had been unpleasant in the past, return to his service
once more, and things should be as they had been
at the return from England? And Boris could only
weep for joy, and this foolishness was the wisest thing
he could find to do.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />

WITH THE TSAR AGAIN.</h2>


<p>Supper at Karapselka that night was a happy
meal for Boris and his wife, though Nancy, as
a matter of fact, preserved her secret private opinion
as to the rights and wrongs of the quarrel over the
Streltsi, and did not altogether forgive Peter for his
conduct at that time. But Boris was happy in his
restoration to the Tsar's favour&mdash;that was enough for
Nancy to think of to-night; and the Tsar was certainly
all kindness and cordiality and friendship
towards her husband. And so the evening was a
right joyous one to herself as well as to Boris.</p>

<p>Peter declared that now he was here he should
stay and have one more hunt with his bear-eater
before returning to Moscow. As for his suite and
their feelings, they deserved a lesson for their awkwardness
in losing their master in the forest. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
might roam the woods in search of him all night and
to-morrow morning as well. If one or two of the
lazy hounds were eaten by wolves, so much the
better; there would be vacancies for better men!</p>

<p>Accordingly, arrangements were made for the Tsar
to sleep at Karapselka, and Nancy went upstairs to
prepare the best bed and the most luxurious coverings
and decorations that the house afforded. And an
extremely good piece of work she made of it; for
Nancy was a young person of some taste in these
matters. But when the Tsar was shown, with pride,
to his chamber, the very first thing he did was to
gather all these Turkish coverings and Persian silk
draperies and fineries together and pitch an armful of
them outside the door; after which he dragged the
hardest of the mattresses from the bedstead, laid it
upon the floor, and slept upon it.</p>

<p>In the morning, Tsar and hunter had a great spin
on snow-shoes. They found a lynx track, which was
great good luck, Boris said, for lynxes are rare; and
following it for miles, they eventually came so close
upon the animal's heels that it was forced to run up
a tree to avoid being caught and killed from behind.
No shaking of the tree from below could bring the
lynx to the ground, and it appeared that the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
must either be shot in the tree or fetched down by
hand&mdash;which is an exceedingly unpleasant process,
and not to be recommended to the amateur.</p>

<p>"Now, Boris," said the Tsar, "shall it be you or I?
We are both fairly good at climbing the rigging!"
But the hunter could not think of a Tsar of Russia
climbing a pine tree after a lynx, and was half-way
up before the words were well out of Peter's mouth.</p>

<p>The lynx looked down the tree and up the tree,
and ran up a little higher, till the top of the pine
bent with its weight like a fishing-rod. Then it
looked at the next tree, which was the better part of
ten yards away; and glared down at Boris, and hissed
like a great cat at bay to a dog. Suddenly the
creature jumped straight for the nearest tree, and
alighted fairly upon an outstanding branch; but,
alas, the branch was a dead one, and broke with the
weight, and down came the lynx with a thud to the
earth close to the feet of the Tsar. Down came
Boris also, almost as rapidly, and he and the Tsar
threw themselves upon the animal almost at the
same instant.</p>

<p>Though stunned with its fall, the infuriated lynx,
which vies with the tiger for ferocity when at bay,
instantly seized the Tsar by the leg&mdash;the imperial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
limb being clad, luckily for the imperial feelings, in
thick Russian thigh-boots&mdash;whereupon Peter caught
the animal's neck with one great hand, and deftly
passed his knife across its yellow throat with the
other. The sharp teeth loosened their hold of the
leather hunting-boots, the terrible claws relaxed, the
wicked, yellow-green eye grew slowly dim, and the
lynx lay dead at Peter's feet.</p>

<p>The Tsar was as pleased as a schoolboy with his
success, and together he and Boris skinned the creature
as a memento of the exploit.</p>

<p>Afterwards, as the pair strolled together through
the woods, the talk fell upon politics and the projects
of Peter. War was certain and imminent, the
Tsar said; Poland had joined with him in an engagement
to drive the Swede out of the Baltic.</p>

<p>"Only think of it, my Bear-eater," said Peter, "the
Baltic!&mdash;ports, Boris, seaports! How we shall fight
for our windows. If it takes us a score of years, we
shall have them!"</p>

<p>The Tsar spoke more prophetically than he knew
of; for those ports were won indeed, but the final
winning of them actually did cost Russia twenty
years of fighting by sea and land, so stubborn was
the struggle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>Then came the question as to what part Boris
should play in these weighty projects which were so
soon to be embarked upon; and at this point the
hunter's exultation received a check, for Peter spoke
as though it must be taken for granted that Boris
would recommence his career at the foot of the
ladder&mdash;he must enlist. That, the Tsar explained,
was indispensable; for he could not stultify himself
by taking Boris back straight into all the ranks and
dignities of his former position. What would the rest
of the officers of the Preobrajensk think? Yes, Boris
must enlist.</p>

<p>Boris looked foolish, but said nothing. For the
life of him, he could not tell whether the Tsar was
pleased to joke with him or was serious.</p>

<p>"I am only a major myself, you know," continued
Peter, "and I cannot have officers admitted into the
regiment at a grade senior to my own; that would
delay my promotion."</p>

<p>"Very well then, your Majesty," said Boris, simply
because he could think of nothing else to say, "then
I enlist."</p>

<p>"Come, come, then," said Peter, "we've made a
start. I congratulate you, Mr. Private-soldier Boris
Ivanitch, and may your promotion be speedy!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris began to think that the Tsar was scarcely
treating an old friend very generously. He grinned,
however, weakly, because there was nothing else to
do, and said he was "much obliged."</p>

<p>"Let me see," Peter continued, after a pause; "was
it you or was it another who saved me from an old
she-bear at Archangel some years since?"</p>

<p>Boris began to fear for the Tsar's reason, but he
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was I, your Majesty; but then you had befriended
me a few days before, so that we were quits
for that."</p>

<p>"What! the bear you ran away from? Dear
me! yes; so I did. Well, well, never mind that.
As I was about to observe, in consideration of the
service you did me on that day, I think you might
be allowed a step in rank&mdash;say a corporal. You are
promoted, Mr. Corporal!"</p>

<p>"I am extremely obliged," said poor Boris, bewildered.</p>

<p>"Who was it behaved rather well that afternoon
when the pack of wolves attacked us?" asked Peter,
with perfectly-assumed seriousness, a minute or two
later. "Was it you or old Ivan the driver?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Ivan, your Majesty," said Boris, nettled at the
Tsar's levity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah, modest as usual!" said the Tsar. "But it
won't do, Boris; you must be promoted, whether you
like it or not! Sergeant of the Preobrajensk, I congratulate
you!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, your Majesty; but surely I have
already received all the recognition those services
deserved, for you rewarded me well at the time with
many favours."</p>

<p>"Well, now, there's a good deal in what you say,"
said Peter, still quite serious, "and perhaps you are
right. Your promotion, Mr. Sergeant Boris Ivanitch,
should, properly speaking, follow some signal achievement
of the present time, and not be awarded for
services long past. Now, see what I have in my
mind. You were a good jumper in the old days; I
daresay you are stiffer now, for want of practice.
Here I lay my cap on the ground: for every foot you
can jump beyond the distance of five yards, you shall
have a step in rank. There, now, that's fair enough;
only don't jump yourself into a major-general, for I
have too many of them on my hands already."</p>

<p>"Come, come!" thought Boris, "if the Tsar is in
this playful mood, I'm his man!" So the hunter
stripped off his kaftan and laid aside his heavy long-boots,
and chose a spot where the snow was hard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
enough to bear him running over it, and stood ready
to jump for his rank and position in life.</p>

<p>"Three jumps," said the Tsar, "and I'll measure
the best. My foot is just an English foot, without the
boot."</p>

<p>Boris girt up his loins, took a good run, and
launched himself into space. But he was stiff, and
barely cleared the five-yard mark planted by the
Tsar.</p>

<p>"Only just got your commission," Peter remarked.
"That won't do; you must leap better than that."</p>

<p>At the second attempt Boris cleared a foot and a
half over the mark.</p>

<p>"Better!" said the Tsar; "but leap well up for
your last!"</p>

<p>This time the hunter, who was getting into the
way of it now, sprang so lightly and powerfully that
the Tsar ran up excitedly to measure the distance.
As he placed his feet down one behind the other,
measuring, he ticked off the promotions thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Sub-lieutenant, lieutenant, captain, major, and a
bit&mdash;say brevet lieutenant-colonel. Bravo, bravo,
Colonel Bear-eater, 'tis a good jump&mdash;nineteen and a
half feet&mdash;and it has landed you one grade above
me! A good jump indeed!" And so pleased was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
the Tsar with his pleasantry, that he caused Boris's
commission to be made out endorsed with all these
promotions, "for special service."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Boris found great changes in Moscow. As he and
the Tsar reached the western gate of the city, the
hunter was immensely surprised to observe hanging
upon a large post what at first sight appeared to be a
human being, but which proved, on closer inspection,
to be a suit of clothes such as he had seen worn in
London by the people of the country. Written underneath
the clothes, in large letters that all might read,
was a notice to the effect that it was the Tsar's will
that all his subjects above the rank of peasant should
wear clothes of a cut similar to the suit here represented.
Any who left or arrived in the city by any
gate thereof, at any time after the 1st January 1700,
without having previously complied with this ookaz,
should be condemned to pay a heavy fine, or submit
to have their kaftans cut short to the knee by the
gatekeeper.</p>

<p>Peter informed his companion that most people
had quietly submitted to the change, but that there
were still many who would neither wear the new
clothes nor pay the fine which would be payable at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
each passing through the gates of the city, whether
leaving or returning; and that these men went with
kaftans cut short to the knee, to the huge delight of
the people.</p>

<p>Boris saw the gatekeeper in the act of cutting
down a kaftan; and certainly the appearance of the
obstinate gentleman who wore it was funny enough
to justify the amusement which it caused to the
yelling and hooting crowd who watched him leave
the place. Boris laughed till the tears ran down his
cheeks, as he stood with the Tsar and looked on at
the comedy; nor did he stop laughing until the Tsar
jogged him by the elbow and said, "Come, Bear-eater,
your turn; will you pay up or be cut short?" Then
Boris laughed no more, but paid up with the best
grace he could.</p>

<p>And this was the Tsar's method of teaching his
people the way to dress <i>à l'Anglais</i>. Boris noticed,
further, that beards were no longer worn in Moscow,
and found that this also was the result of an ookaz
from Peter, which ookaz cost Boris himself a very
fine specimen of a patriarchal Russian beard; indeed,
when he rode down next day to Karapselka,
poor Nancy did not recognize him in his new style of
apparel and without the flowing ornament to his chin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
though she was bound to admit, when she became
used to them, that both the changes were great improvements
to his personal appearance.</p>

<p>The officers of the Preobrajensk greeted Boris as
one returned from the grave. He had always been
a favourite with his fellows, and their delight to
have him back among them was cordial and sincere.
From them Boris learned that the Tsar's evil humour
had lasted for long months after the hunter's banishment
from Moscow; and that his bitterness against
Boris must have been deep indeed, for that he had
never once mentioned the name of the bear-hunter
in all the three years of his absence. Accordingly,
they congratulated him the more sincerely upon his
return to favour; and when Boris described to the
mess, or rather to the assembled officers at the favourite
eating-house, where his return was celebrated, how
he had literally jumped from non-commissioned rank
to that of brevet lieutenant-colonel, they fairly roared
with laughter in their delight, for, they said, the Tsar
must be quite coming round again to his old <i>status
quo ante Streltsi</i>, and they had not heard of so
"Peterish" an action on his part for many a long day.</p>

<p>So, at last, after three years of quiet life in exile
at Karapselka, Boris was restored to favour, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
entered once more upon an active military career.
For the next three or four years he enjoyed many
opportunities of distinguishing himself in arms, and
of engaging in the kind of stirring adventure which
his soul loved; for, a few months after his arrival,
with Nancy and her babies, in his new Moscow home,
war was declared with Sweden, and the entire army
lately raised by Peter and carefully drilled by himself
and his trusted veteran officers at Preobrajensk, together
with the four old regiments raised by Lefort
and Peter for the siege of Azof, marched away for the
Swedish fortress of Narva, and with them went Boris
the Hunter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.<br />

BORIS HAS A NARROW ESCAPE.</h2>


<p>The formation of the twenty-nine new regiments
which were to take part in the war had been
an arduous undertaking. While Boris was in exile
at Karapselka the Tsar had lost two capable assistants,
as well as dear friends, in Lefort and Gordon, both of
whom had died during that interval of time. Had
these men lived to assist him at this emergency, there
is no doubt that the raw peasantry now sent up for
training at Preobrajensk would have emerged from
their months of drill in a higher state of efficiency
than that in which they actually marched out of
Moscow in August. Nevertheless much had been done,
and the Tsar had worked as few but he could labour
to make soldiers of them. In this matter Boris was
of inestimable service to him; and many a time did
Peter declare that he would not for half his empire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
that those wolves had not run him down in the Karapselka
forest and in doing so brought him back his
bear-eater, for what could he have done without Boris
at this time?</p>

<p>Nancy was sensible enough to see that, happy as
she had been with her husband for three long years
of country life at Karapselka, she must accept the
inevitable, and allow him to do now as his duty and
his manhood dictated. So Boris bade farewell to his
young wife, and the little wolf-maiden and her tiny
brother, and marched away from Moscow with a
feeling that life was recommencing for him&mdash;stern,
workaday, adventurous life&mdash;and that the idle paradise
of Karapselka had been nothing but a dream.</p>

<p>The possession of Livonia and Esthonia, of Ingria
and Karelia was the darling object of Peter's ambition.
He longed for the mastery of the Gulf of Finland and
a grip of the Baltic coast as a hungry man longs for
the food he sees in a shop window. Without some
outlet to the sea in this direction, he well knew that
Russia could never develop her trade and take her
proper position in Europe as a European power.</p>

<p>But Sweden at this time was strong and courageous,
and there sat upon her throne a young prince who
had been devoted from his earliest infancy to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
study of war and its practice in the playground&mdash;Charles
XII.; who at this very moment was proving
to the allies of Russia&mdash;Poland and Denmark&mdash;that
in picking a quarrel with him they had attacked a
hornet's nest. Charles had not as yet attained to
his full reputation as a soldier; but he was formidable
already, and his name was feared and respected by all
who had had dealings with him in the field. For this
reason, Peter knew well that he must proceed with
caution.</p>

<p>No sooner was war declared than he marched
away towards Narva, the nearest Esthonian fortress
occupied by the Swedes; for, could he but possess
himself of this stronghold, he foresaw that the Neva
and the opposite coasts of the Gulf of Finland would
be practically at his mercy, for both Livonia and
Esthonia would be cut off from direct communication
with those parts.</p>

<p>Thus Narva became the first objective for the armies
of Peter. But the journey from Moscow to that
fortress, undertaken at this late season of the year,
proved long and tedious. The transport service was
crude and inefficient, and the want of stores delayed
the march; the roads were frightfully bad, as any one
who knows Russian roads, even at this day, may well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
believe; hence it was not until the first days of November
that the first detachment of troops with a portion
of the artillery arrived before the walls of Narva.</p>

<p>The Tsar himself superintended the placing of the
guns in position, and fired the first shot. It was soon
found that the gun-carriages had been so knocked
about that they would not stand more than two or
three discharges, and then broke in pieces. By the
14th November all the powder and shot had been used,
and the troops were obliged to sit and wait for new
supplies with the best grace they could muster.</p>

<p>During this tiresome period of waiting the garrison
of Narva made several gallant sorties. During one
of these, Peter's own regiment, the Preobrajensk, was
engaged, Boris and the Tsar both fighting at their
posts. One of the foreign officers, a certain Major
Hummert, at one period of the engagement, finding
himself pressed by the Swedes, became alarmed, and
gave the word to retire; thereupon the whole regiment
turned and fled in sudden panic, in spite of all
the efforts of the officers to keep them in their places.
The Tsar was furious, and sent for Hummert in the
evening, when the day's fighting was over, in order to
treat him to one of those ebullitions of passion in
which he indulged on provocation. But poor Hummert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
could not face the ordeal, and escaping from the lines
under cover of the darkness, deserted to the enemy.
Peter hung him in effigy; but the Swedes themselves
improved upon this by hanging the deserter in the
flesh. Shortly after this episode, the Tsar left the
Russian troops at Narva and departed to attend to
other duties, and while he was absent a great and
unexpected misfortune befell the Russians.</p>

<p>No sooner did Charles of Sweden hear of the action
of Peter in laying siege to Narva than he took ship
with nine thousand troops for Revel and Pernau.
Landing at these ports, he marched with all his characteristic
energy and marvellous expedition straight
across country to Narva, falling upon the Russians
from the rear like a sudden terrible tornado. The
Russians, with the exception of the Preobrajensk
and Semenofski&mdash;two of the veteran regiments&mdash;ran
like sheep, hardly striking a blow in self-defence.
They rushed hither and thither headlong, shrieking
that the "Germans had betrayed them," and making
matters very unpleasant for their foreign officers,
many of whom they killed, or chased over the field.
The Preobrajensk, with Boris among them, held out
bravely, and Boris had the honour of crossing swords
with Charles XII. as the latter rode by slashing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
right and left with his weapon, and doing execution
at each passage of his terrible blade. Boris barred
his way, guarded a tremendous downward cut at his
helm, and lunged fiercely back, striking the Swedish
king full in the breast-plate, and causing him to grab
with his left hand at the horse's mane in order to
prevent himself falling over backwards. Charles was
furious, and smote at Boris with such energy that,
though Boris guarded the blow, the sword cut his tall
Preobrajensk helmet clean in two, but fortunately left
his head untouched. Then the hunter's blood was
thoroughly up, and he slashed back at the king with
such good will that his Majesty was knocked clean
off his horse by the force of the blows, though his
body remained unwounded. At the same moment the
horse itself received a flesh wound and dashed away
in terror and pain. But Charles was quickly placed
upon a second horse by his people, who thronged
around when they perceived his dangerous position,
and the king, though he endeavoured to get back to
Boris, was unable, because the crowd separated them.
Charles turned in his saddle and smiled and waved to
Boris. "Well done, Russian," he shouted. "I am glad
there are not many of them like you! We'll finish
this another day!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>But Boris, together with the rest of his regiment,
was being forced back at this moment, fighting for
every yard of ground, and he had no time to respond
to his Majesty's kind attentions. Bravely the Preobrajensk
fought, but the weight of numbers drove
them back surely and steadily; and now they were
upon the bridge which the Russians themselves had
built in order to connect the two portions of their
camp, which occupied both sides of the river. Suddenly,
the bridge being crammed at the moment with
crowds of Russian soldiers and gun-carriages, all retiring
face to foe, there was a terrible sound of crashing
and rending timbers, which rose above the din of musketry
fire, the shouting of officers, and the cries of
the wounded, and in an instant Boris found himself
struggling in the half-frozen waters of the river, one
of several hundred Russians in the same predicament.</p>

<p>As we have had occasion to see during the course
of his adventurous career, water had no terrors for
Boris; but to the danger of drowning was added on
this occasion a far greater peril. The banks were
lined with Swedish soldiers, and these men immediately
opened fire upon the unfortunate Russians in
the water. As Charles wrote to a friend after the
battle, "The greatest fun was when the bridge broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
and tumbled the Russians into the water. The whole
surface of the river was crammed with heads and legs
of men and horses sticking up, and my men shot at
them as though they were ducks."</p>

<p>It may have been very amusing for Charles XII.
to watch, but it was very poor fun for Boris and his
unfortunate companions, who were drowned around
him in scores, while hundreds of others were killed
by the rain of bullets poured upon them from the
banks.</p>

<p>Boris felt that this was indeed a critical moment
in his career, for if he allowed his head to remain
a moment above the surface his life was not worth a
moment's purchase. Accordingly, the hunter allowed
himself to sink to the bottom, and then swam under
water down the current, as fast and as far as his
breath would hold out. The water was freezing cold,
and he was much hampered in his swimming by the
numbers of drowning men whom he was obliged to
circumvent as far as possible for fear of being seized
and drowned before he could escape from the grip
of despair.</p>

<p>Boris came to the surface some twenty yards from
the bridge, but the bullets were falling upon the
water like hailstones in a sharp shower, and after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
taking a gulp or two of air he sank once more. He
was instantly gripped by a drowning man, who clung
to his throat with both hands. Boris felt that his
last hour was come, and said the prayer of the dying;
nevertheless he gripped the man by the neck also,
and it became a strangling match. For ten seconds
or so, which seemed an eternity, both men throttled
each other in this strange and unnatural duel, and
then Boris saw the man's mouth open wide and the
water pour in, and the poor fellow's grasp relaxed
and let go, and he floated away.</p>

<p>Boris rose to the surface a second time, but little
further from the bridge than before. Finding a
dead body floating beside him as he rose, he used this
as a screen from the fire while he took four or five
deep lungfuls of air. He was used to the water now
and did not feel it so cold. He dived again, and
this time he swam under water for a long distance,
coming to the surface far enough from the bridge to
be out of the great crush of struggling humanity.</p>

<p>From this point his progress was much easier; and
though he was shot at several times, none of the
bullets struck him. One Swedish soldier ran down
the bank after him, and fired twice as he rose. Boris
was obliged to pretend that he was hit in order to rid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
himself of this tiresome individual. He raised his
arms and gave a cry as of one sorely struck, and sank;
but came to the surface ten yards further up stream
and close under the bank, whence he watched the
soldier look out for him to appear at a point lower
down, his musket ready to shoot again. Presently the
man, satisfied that Boris was "done for," came slowly
along towards the bridge, and the hunter bobbed beneath
the current, though he stood in shallow water
close to the low bank. As he came up again the
Swedish soldier was just passing him, but he did
not see him, for he was gazing towards the bridge,
looking out for more Russian ducks to wing. Boris
could not resist the temptation, but stretched out
his arm and seized the man by the leg, pulling
him violently as he did so. The Swede slipped and
fell with a cry of surprise and alarm; but Boris
dragged him remorselessly down into the cold stream
before he could recover himself, and pushing him out
into deep water drowned him then and there as a
punishment for his cruelty in shooting poor, struggling
Russians as they battled for life with the river.</p>

<p>Almost worn out, Boris, by swimming and diving,
succeeded in making his way to a turn of the stream
where he was out of sight of the bridge and its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
tragedies, and he came to the shore for a good
rest.</p>

<p>He was numb and cold and stiff, and finding a
dead Swedish soldier he took the liberty of divesting
him of his uniform and of putting himself into it,
leaving his own wet garments on the ground. He
took the man's sword and pistol also; and thus provided,
Boris felt that, all things considered, he had
come fairly well out of this adventure.</p>

<p>After resting a while, the hunter took careful observations
from a neighbouring tree to discover in
which direction the Russian army had fled, and how
best to avoid the Swedish troops which, he imagined,
would be sure to have followed in close pursuit. But
Boris soon found that he had little to fear from the
Swedish forces. They had by this time all returned
to the Russian camp, and were now making free with
the Russian provisions, which they much needed, since
they had marched for nearly three days without
resting and with scarcely any food to eat, thanks to
the energy and military ardour of their young king,
who was determined to reach the Russian position
before rumours of his landing should have spoiled his
game.</p>

<p>That night every Swedish soldier in his army was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
drunk with Russian vodka; and had the Russians
known it, they might have returned and made short
work of their late victors. But the troops of the
Tsar were now far away, heading for home as rapidly
as they could get over the ground, in terror for their
lives, and imagining that the Swedes with that terrible
young king at their head would overtake them
and cut them to pieces at any moment.</p>

<p>Thus Peter's first attempt to wrest a fortress from
Sweden proved a terrible failure; but the experience
was by no means an unmixed disaster for Russia,
because of its different effect upon the minds of the
two sovereigns concerned. Charles was puffed up
with pride and vainglory, and from the day of his
victory at Narva imagined himself to be invincible,
and the Russians to be mere sheep who would scatter
at any time at the barking of a dog. The Tsar, on
the other hand, took his defeat coolly and sensibly.
It was an object lesson, and he recognized it as such.
His men were, he knew, mere recruits; the troops
of Charles were veterans. He studied the details of
the fight as reported to him by his generals, and
learned, by careful comparison, where the Swedish
generalship had been superior to the Russian, and
made a note of it. "We shall learn to fight by-and-by!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
he said; "and when we have learned
what Charles has to teach us, we shall practise our
knowledge upon our teacher!" Events proved that
Narva was a blessing in disguise to the vanquished
Russian troops, and that this was so is due to the
greatness of Peter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />

HOW BORIS OUTWITTED THE SWEDISH
ADMIRAL.</h2>


<p>His reverse at Narva aroused the Tsar to
tremendous exertions. He met the remains
of his beaten troops at Novgorod, where he
ordered every portion of the scattered army to assemble
and report itself. The town of Novgorod
first, and afterwards those of Pskof and Petcherski&mdash;the
site of the famous monastery&mdash;were strongly
fortified and garrisoned, as the frontier to be
defended against a possible advance of the enemy.
For the work of fortification every man, woman, and
child in the several districts was employed; the
services in the churches were suspended in order that
the priests might be free to assist in the business
of national defence; houses and even churches were
pulled down if they in any degree impeded the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
work; the bells of cathedrals and monasteries all
over the country were melted down to supply metal
for the forging of cannon; and through it all Peter
himself worked like a common labourer in the
trenches, except that he did as much work as any
three other men. His disposition towards those
generals who had been beaten at Narva was kind,
and he did not this time allow his passion to get
the mastery of his judgment; so that all men worked
in harmony for the defence of the fatherland.</p>

<p>Gradually the troops dribbled into Novgorod, arriving
sometimes in bodies of several hundreds, and
occasionally in small companies of ten or a dozen men.</p>

<p>One fine afternoon a small company reached the
town, bringing with them a Swedish prisoner, whom
they led straight to the Tsar as he stood working in
the trenches, exceedingly proud of their achievement
in having secured and retained the fellow, for he was
a big man, much bigger than any of themselves, and a
good deal too big for his clothes. The men marched
up to the trench where the Tsar was busy with his
spade, and stood at attention. Peter looked up after
a while. "Well," he said, "what is it?"</p>

<p>"A Swedish prisoner, your Majesty," said the men.</p>

<p>Peter was all attention immediately, for this was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the first prisoner brought in, and he might prove
an exceedingly valuable source of information as to
Charles's intended movements. The Tsar fumbled
in his pocket for loose cash, intending to bestow a
gratuity on those who had effected the capture. But
as he did so his eye fell upon the face of the prisoner.
Peter stared at the fellow. Suddenly his countenance
changed, and he burst into one of his loudest laughs.</p>

<p>"Bear-eater," he said, "I shall never believe you
dead again, until I bury you with my own hands.&mdash;Get
out there, you idiots, and report yourselves to
your colonel; your prisoner is about as much a Swede
as I am.&mdash;Here, Boris, my wonderful Bear-eater, come
into this ditch, if you aren't a ghost, and tell me all
about it. Don't think I am not mighty glad to see
you; but there's no time for chatting idly. Get a
spade and come in; we can talk as we dig."</p>

<p>So Boris was obliged to do half a day's work in
the trenches while he told the Tsar his story, part of
which we know.</p>

<p>"At last," Boris continued, having described his
adventures in the water, and how he had travelled
half the night in pursuit of the retiring Russian
troops&mdash;"at last I overtook those heroes there, who,
seeing that I was in a Swedish uniform, were at first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
for catching up all they were possessed of and continuing
their headlong flight; but finding that I was
but one belated man, and without a musket besides,
they gallantly surrounded me and discussed my throat
as a suitable whetstone for their swords. I informed
them in my purest Russian that I was of their own
way of thinking&mdash;not as to my throat, but politically;
but they were not to be taken in, and declared that I
was a Swedish spy, and as such ought to be shot. I
pointed out that, even if this were so, it would be far
better to make me a prisoner and take me straight to
the Tsar, who would give them a handsome gratuity
for their service. What would they gain by shooting
me down? There would be no nachaiok [tea-money],
and no glory either; for none would believe them,
and they could not well take along my body for
evidence, with the Swedish troops in full pursuit behind
them; it would hamper their movements and
prevent their escape! This last consideration decided
them, and they took me prisoner, and bound me hand
and foot. One of them had secured a horse, and as
I found it awkward to walk all tied up like a bit of
boiled beef, they put me on the horse and gave me a
pleasant lift to Novgorod; and here I am."</p>

<p>"Well done, my Bear-eater," said the Tsar, delighted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
with the tale. "I thought we could trust
you to take good care of yourself, and, believing this,
I did not send word to Nancy of your death&mdash;which
is just as well. And now I have plenty of work for
you!"</p>

<p>There was indeed work, not only for Boris but for
all those who had the safety of the country at heart.
Besides the fortifying of the frontier towns, there was
much recruiting to be done. The Tsar would have
nine new regiments of dragoons formed at once; this
being one of the results of his object lesson at Narva,
where the cavalry of Charles had swept Peter's timid
footmen before them like autumn leaves before the
storm-wind. Then the infantry regiments must be
patched up with new men to fill the gaps. And the
drilling of all these soldiers, new and old, must be
taken in hand by men like Boris qualified to undertake
it. All this necessary work was set agoing without
a moment's delay by the never-weary Tsar; and
so well did it proceed that, within a few months after
the rout at Narva, Peter found himself in possession
of a far better army than that which he had left
beneath the walls of the Swedish fortress to be cut to
pieces by the enemy as soon as he had turned his
back.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris was as busy as man could be over his various
occupations, but found time to write continually to
Moscow, where his letters comforted and entertained
his wife amazingly, whose faith in the star of Boris
was so great, that even his narrative of the adventures
at and after Narva alarmed her less than they amused
her. She felt, as the Tsar had declared that he also
felt, that under any conceivable circumstances her
husband was well able to take care of himself.</p>

<p>But with the spring came a change for the hunter.
News arrived that the Swedish fleet meditated a
descent upon Archangel as soon as the disappearance
of the ice should have rendered navigation possible.
Boris, to his delight, was sent up north to superintend
the fortification of the old town which had been the
home of his boyhood and early youth. The hunter
received his new commission with joy, and started at
once, passing through those forests and villages which
were memorable by reason of his adventures with the
Tsar nearly ten years ago. Though there was no
time to waste, Boris managed to enjoy a day or two
in the woods, after his old friends the bears and wolves,
and reached Archangel early in April, when he commenced
the work of fortifying the place without
further delay.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>And now the hunter was to experience one of the
most exciting of all the adventures of his chequered
career. Scarcely was the ice away, and the mouth of
the Dwina open to navigation, than one fine day in
May there appeared a fleet of, seemingly, English and
Dutch merchant vessels, which sailed in from sea
and anchored off the island of Modiug. Suspecting
nothing, a boat containing fifteen soldiers, acting as
custom-house officials, made the usual visit to the
foreign ships to collect the harbour dues, receive
the reports of cargo, and go through the ordinary
commercial formalities in connection with the port.
These men did not return at once; and when night
fell and they were still absent, the authorities were
obliged to conclude that the Dutch or British skippers
had proved too hospitable, and that the officials were
still occupied in drinking the health of the first arrivals
of the year. But in the middle of the night
Boris, in his capacity of commissioner of the Tsar,
was awakened from his sleep by a half-drowned,
dripping person, who stated that he was one of those
who had been sent on board the supposed English
and Dutch merchantmen. He had swum ashore
at Modiug, he said, having escaped from the cabin
in which the company had been confined. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
rest were still on board, and likely to remain so;
for the ships were not merchantmen but vessels of
war, and their crews were not good Englishmen and
Dutchmen but blackguardly Swedes, sailing under
false colours in order to steal a march upon the forts
and capture the city unawares as soon as the first
glimmering of light should render such an enterprise
possible. The man had climbed out, by the help of
his companions, through the skylight, choosing his
time when the sentry had his back turned, had crept
to the side, let himself down by means of a rope, and
swum to the island. There he found a boat, and got
himself rowed quickly to the town; and here he was!
The man added that he had overheard it said that
three of the vessels would signal for a pilot in the
morning, and sail into port; the remainder of the fleet
were to wait where they were, in case of accidents,
and would come on if required.</p>

<p>Boris made glad the heart of this dripping hero by
rewarding him handsomely in money, and promising
to mention his conduct to the Tsar at the first opportunity.
Then the hunter sat down to think matters
out, and the result of his cogitations was, first, a visit
to the commandant of the fort, to whom he gave his
instructions. After this Boris got himself ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the further development of his plans, and took up
his position in the pilot-house, whence a good view
of the foreigners would be obtained as soon as it
became light enough to see. Boris had concocted a
delightful plot, and hugged himself with joy to think
how the Tsar would roar with laughter when he told
him of it, after its successful outcome. It did not
occur to Boris that he ran about as good a chance of
having his own throat cut as ever man deliberately
set himself to run; but then Boris was a great believer
in his own star, and would have laughed at the
very idea of danger in his scheme.</p>

<p>When morning came, Boris soon observed the usual
signal flying from the deceitful flag-ship's mainmast
indicating that a pilot was required. Then he arrayed
himself in an over-garment, which caused him to look
as much like a pilot as any other man, stepped into
the pilot-boat, and had himself conveyed on board the
Swedish admiral's ship, to the great astonishment of
the real pilot, who could not imagine why the Tsar's
commissioner usurped his duties when he had plenty
of his own to look after.</p>

<p>When Boris stepped aboard the frigate, the Swedish
admiral did not pretend to be other than he really
was, but roughly bade the "pilot" take the vessel into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
Archangel harbour. The pilot, simulating great fear
and distress of mind, did as he was told&mdash;the frigate,
followed by its two companions, sailing gallantly
forward on a light wind direct for port.</p>

<p>But that deceitful pilot did not intend that those
Swedish ships should ever reach the harbour save
under the Russian flag, and before a mile of water had
been covered they were all three suddenly brought up
by running straight upon a sandbank which jutted
out from the island of Modiug. When the admiral
and the rest of the Swedish gentlemen who happened
to be on deck at the moment of the catastrophe had
picked themselves up from the undignified attitudes
into which they had been thrown by the shock, they
learned two extremely unpleasant things. One was
that their pilot had left them the legacy of his topcoat,
and had taken a neat header into the water,
whence he was now addressing certain remarks to
them in the English language, remarks of a valedictory
nature, coupled with flattering expressions of the hope
that he would soon have the pleasure of meeting
them again on shore; and the other that the forts
were in the act of opening fire upon them as they lay
helpless and immovable upon the sandbank.</p>

<p>Within half a minute of the first discovery a dozen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
furious Swedes had snatched their muskets, and a dozen
Swedish bullets whistled through the air and sent up
little fountains of spray as they struck the water
somewhere near the spot where the head of that pilot
had last appeared. But the head was no longer there.
When it appeared again it did so in a direction
where it was not expected; and though the bullets
sought it once more, they did not find it. The furious
Swedes even went so far as to train a gun upon the
vanishing black spot, and banged away merrily at it
with musket and cannon as long as it was in sight,
but never went within several yards of the mark; for
Boris dived so deftly and dodged so cunningly that
he invariably had plenty of time to fill his lungs
before he was seen and shot at.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the fort blazed away at the stranded
ships, with such success that these soon hauled down
their colours; after which a party of Russians from
the fort put off in boats to take possession, picking
up the swimming pilot on their way. Once on board,
the Russians turned the ships' guns upon the four
remaining Swedish vessels and quickly drove them
from their moorings.</p>

<p>Boris was not mistaken as to the Tsar's delight
upon hearing of his exploit. Peter wrote him an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
affectionate and appreciative letter, in which he congratulated
him on his out-foxing the old Swedish
reynard, presented him with a gratuity of two thousand
roubles, and gave him a commission in the navy.
Peter himself was at this time a boatswain in the
same service, having risen, some say, from the humble
position of cabin-boy, in which capacity he had
insisted upon entering the navy in order that he
might experience the duties of every grade of both
branches of the service.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.<br />

SMALL BEGINNINGS OF A GREAT CITY.</h2>


<p>Boris lived on at Archangel during the whole
of the summer of 1701; but his Majesty of
Sweden did not venture to send a second force to
Russia's only seaport, the first lesson having proved
a salutary one. Boris had therefore plenty of time
for the indulgence of his passion for hunting, and
during those pleasant months he was fully occupied in
clearing the country around, including his own native
village, of the bears which infested it. The peasants
declared that they had suffered from a plague of bears
since his departure, for there had been no one to rid
the place of them. Accordingly, the hunter had a
grand summer of it among the members of the Bruin
family, who must have regretted his reappearance as
fervently as the peasants rejoiced over it. Nancy
with the little ones had joined Boris at Archangel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
and the pair enjoyed many days together in the
woods, days which reminded them of old Moscow
times and recalled the three quiet years at Karapselka.</p>

<p>With the approach of winter, however, came letters
from the Tsar appointing Boris to the command of
one of the new regiments of infantry, and requiring
his immediate attendance at the head of his men to
act under the orders of General Sheremetieff, who
had already had a brush with the Swedes at Rappin
in Livonia, and was now waiting to follow up his
success there with a more important affair. In
January the opportunity arrived, and a serious engagement
was fought at Erestfer, Boris being present
with his regiment. On this occasion the Russian
troops gained a victory which went far to efface the
memory of Narva. Three thousand of the troops of
Charles XII. were left dead upon the field, after both
sides had fought for several hours with the greatest
courage and determination. Every officer engaged
in this fight was promoted or decorated, Sheremetieff
being made field-marshal, and Boris receiving the
decoration of St. Ann. The troops marched into
Moscow in triumph, and a solemn Te Deum was
chanted in the national cathedral in the Kremlin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>The Russians followed up this success with a
second brilliant victory at Hummelshof, which decided
the fate of Livonia; and this unfortunate province
was given over to devastation, from the effects
of which it took many years to recover. Swedish
prisoners became so common that a boy or a girl of
fifteen years of age could be bought for the sum of
fourpence.</p>

<p>Boris was not present at this second battle, for he
had at this time accompanied the Tsar to Archangel,
whither Peter had travelled on ship-building intent.
Here the pair had a small adventure with a bear.
Boris had introduced the Tsar on this occasion to a
new method of hunting the bear&mdash;that of sitting in
ambush over the carcass of a horse or a cow, in the
hope that the bear will scent the delicacy and arrive
to make a meal of it. On the occasion in question
the Tsar and Boris had sat up in the branches of
two pine trees opposite each other for two nights
without result, and were in the midst of a third,
which Peter vowed should be the last&mdash;for the carcass
was by this time so very unsavoury that nothing
would induce him to sit there another night&mdash;when
of a sudden the watchers became aware by sundry
gruntings and shufflings in the distance that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
guest for whom the feast had been set was approaching.</p>

<p>It was a moonlight night, and Peter, being anxious
to secure the brute while he could see to shoot,
sighted him as best he could, and pulled the trigger.
The bullet passed through one of the bear's ears, and
only served to enrage it. Seeing the smoke hanging
about the tree in which the Tsar sat, the angry brute
rightly guessed that its assailant lurked amid the
branches, and with a roar of rage and defiance it
dashed to the foot of the tree, intent upon climbing
it and fetching down the rash person who had dared
to burn its ear with a hot iron.</p>

<p>The Tsar had nothing but his knife to protect
himself with; and remembering this, Boris was
somewhat concerned to observe the course which
events had taken. He was not long in making up
his mind, however, that he must shoot and that
quickly, for the bear was already half-way up the
trunk of the pine. Boris hastily put his gun to his
shoulder and fired, but his bullet did nothing better
than hit the furious brute in the foot, redoubling its
fury.</p>

<p>The Tsar was now in a somewhat serious position,
for it is never pleasant to be obliged to face a bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
with no weapon excepting a knife, and from the
insecure position of a pine branch it is even less
agreeable than on <i>terra firma</i>. Peter nevertheless
drew his knife and settled himself in his place, resolved
to make things as unpleasant as possible for
the visitor, as soon as he should come within striking
distance.</p>

<p>Up came Bruin, hand over hand, climbing very
fast, and already the Tsar was slashing at him,
though as yet without reaching him, when suddenly,
with a loud roar of rage, the bear let go his hold
of the tree trunk and slipped down to the ground,
clutching at the stem of the tree as he went. Boris,
seeing the Tsar's danger, had slipped down from his
perch, and with a bound just succeeded in catching
hold of the bear's hind feet, from which he dangled
and swung with all his weight. This sudden mysterious
tugging from below had so startled Bruin that
he let go and fell together with poor Boris to the
ground, the hunter being undermost. The bear caught
him by the leg as he attempted to crawl away from
beneath, and inflicted a nasty wound. But just at
this moment the Tsar dropped from his perch to
the ground, and stepping behind the bear as it tore
at the poor hunter's leg, he deftly inserted his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
sharp blade in the brute's windpipe and ended the
fray.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Soon after this last episode, Boris having recovered
from his wounds, the Tsar left Archangel with the
hunter, full of plans for a great <i>coup</i> to be directed
at that portion of the Swedish king's territory which
he coveted far more than any other. Peter went
south through the Onega lake, thence by the river
Svir to Lake Ladoga, where he met by appointment
Sheremetieff with his army of thirteen thousand men,
still flushed with their great victory at Hummelshof.
After a few days' rest, Peter fell upon the small
fortress of Noteburg, which stood upon a tiny island
just where the Neva flows out of Ladoga. This
fortress was attacked with great spirit, and was
defended with equal gallantry by its Swedish garrison.
On the second day, Peter received a letter from
the "ladies of Noteburg," begging that they might be
allowed to leave the place, the Russian fire being
rather warmer than they liked. The Tsar, however,
returned a characteristic reply to the effect that he
could not think of permitting the ladies to travel
alone in these troublous times; they were quite at
liberty to depart, however, if they took their husbands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
with them. So on the third day of the siege,
the ladies actually persuaded their lords to escort them
to the nearest Swedish stronghold, and the place was
evacuated.</p>

<p>The capture of Noteburg was most important,
since it furnished the Tsar with the mastery of the
Neva, so far as its upper waters were concerned, and
there now remained but one small fortress between
him and the open sea. This was a day of joy for
Peter. The fort at Noteburg was rechristened Schlüsselburg,
and the Tsar caused the key of the castle to
be fastened to a bastion as an indication that here
was the <i>open sesame</i> to the Neva, which was the gate
of the sea.</p>

<p>Having proceeded thus far towards the attainment
of his ends, the conqueror, leaving a strong force in
possession of his newly-acquired fortress of Schlüsselburg,
and with it our friend the hunter, hurried away
to Voronej in order to see to the ship-building on the
Don, and to keep an eye upon the movements of
Turkey, whom he suspected of designs upon his city
of Azof, the Tartar stronghold whence Boris had
escaped on a memorable occasion.</p>

<p>Boris found life at Schlüsselburg very pleasant.
It was winter time, and the forest in this part of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
country was full of game, so that he had ample
opportunity both to enjoy himself and also to instruct
his fellow officers in the delights of the chase. Wolf
hunting became the fashionable occupation among the
garrison of Schlüsselburg, and many were the exciting
hunts and adventures which occurred during those
months, not always to the final triumph of the hunters;
for more than one inexperienced sportsman met
with his end at the teeth of a desperate wolf, or in
the close embrace of a bear who would not be denied
the pleasure of hugging one of his Majesty's subjects.
But my readers will pardon me if I do not enter into
details of these events in this place, for there is
matter of more moment to be described.</p>

<p>The Tsar, having satisfied himself that all was
right in the south, returned to Schlüsselburg in the
early part of the year 1703, and without loss of
time proceeded to do that which set the seal upon
Russia's greatness by providing her for ever with
that window into Europe, to attain which was the
main object of his life. Peter marched down the
flat banks of the Neva with an army of twenty
thousand men until he came to a spot where a small
stream called the Ochta mingles its waters with those
of the larger river. Here was situated the Swedish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
stronghold of Nyenkanz, which was quickly bombarded
by the Russian troops, and captured the following
day. Peter rechristened this fort Slotburg, and from
this small beginning there arose in a very few years the
city of St. Petersburg, which was built around the
nucleus afforded by this little fort.</p>

<p>Soon after the capture of this all-important <i>pied-à-terre</i>,
the garrison were startled to hear one day the
sound of two cannon shots coming from the direction
of the Gulf of Finland, which opens out almost from
the very city of St. Petersburg. Peter, guessing rightly
that this was a signal from a Swedish fleet which
approached in ignorance that the place was in the
hands of the Russians, immediately replied with a
similar discharge of two pieces. Within an hour a
row-boat appeared, and was allowed to approach close
up to the walls of the fort, when its crew were made
prisoners, to their unbounded astonishment. From
these men Peter learned that the fleet consisted of
nine ships of war. Soon after two large vessels were
observed to leave the fleet and sail up the Neva as far
as the island now forming the northern half of the
city, and known as Vasili Ostrof (William, or Basil
Island). Here they anchored by reason of the darkness.
They had come to see why their boat had not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
returned, and what was the meaning of the suspicious
absence of the usual courtesies between garrisons and
maritime visitors.</p>

<p>That night Peter prepared thirty large flat-bottomed
boats, and when morning came loaded these
full with two regiments of the Guards, and made the
best of his way, by a circuitous route, towards the
Swedish frigates. The Neva, just before throwing
itself into the gulf at St. Petersburg, spreads out
into several branches, like the fingers of a hand,
the spaces between these fingers being occupied by
islands. Hidden among these islands, the barges of
the Tsar had no difficulty in keeping themselves
out of sight, and after a thorough inspection of the
Swedish strength it was resolved to make a dash
and, if possible, board the vessels. Accordingly the
long oars were got out, and the barges glided silently
around the eastern end of Basil Island, massed just
at that corner where the Bourse now stands, and
at a given signal dashed round the corner and were
upon the astonished Swedes in a moment. Before
the enemy could do anything to prevent it, boarding-ladders
were placed at the ships' sides, and crowds of
the Russian Guards swarmed up and over the bulwarks,
sword in hand, Peter and Boris among the foremost.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span></p>

<p>From the first the Swedes were at a hopeless disadvantage,
and in half-an-hour or less the sailor Tsar
found himself in possession of two very fine specimens
of the warship of that day, and, what was still better,
the undisputed proprietor of a fine natural harbour,
with outlet to the sea, to keep them in.</p>

<p>There was no happier man inhabiting this planet
that evening than Peter Alexeyevitch; and if he
demonstrated his delight by dancing upon the supper-table
after that meal was over, we must regard with
indulgence this characteristic manner of working off
the exuberance of his feelings in consideration of the
momentous importance of his achievements of the
past few days. For Russia had won her first naval
engagement, and from this day would commence to
rank as a maritime power, and to draw into her
bosom the wealth and the commerce of other nations.
Truly there was something to dance for, even though
it were among empty bottles and upon the top of the
supper-table.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.<br />

HOW THE SWEDES ERECTED A GIBBET
FOR BORIS.</h2>


<p>Now that Russia was, or would be, a maritime
power, the Tsar was determined that those
around him, of every grade, should learn something
of naval affairs. While, therefore, the beginnings
of the city of St. Petersburg were in progress,
the sovereign devised means whereby as many as
possible of his favourite companions and officers,
as well as humbler classes of his subjects, should
at least have the opportunity of learning the use
of sails and oars. Peter organized entertainments
for his people, inviting large numbers to sup with
him each evening in a tent upon an island, which
could only be approached by means of boats or sailing
yachts, for of course there were as yet no bridges.
Peter provided the craft as well as the supper, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
the guests were obliged to navigate for themselves.
Many, the majority indeed, of these had never set
foot in a boat of any sort in their lives, and, notwithstanding
the honour which an invitation to
his Majesty's board undoubtedly carried with it, they
would gladly have gone without both the honour and
the sailing, too. The Tsar's guests were invited to
step into the first boat that came, and whether this
happened to be a rowing or sailing boat they were
expected to find their way unassisted by experts to
the imperial sea-girt pavilion. If this plan was productive
of confusion and exciting incident while the
unfortunate guests set out supperwards, it is easy to
imagine that the scenes when these same gentlemen
returned after their meal and its accompanying potations
must have been doubly entertaining. Wrecks
and drenchings were the rule; prosperous journeys and
the haven safely won the exception. The Tsar stood
upon his island and watched the approach of his
expected guests as one who goes to the play; their
frantic efforts to manage oar and sail gave him the
most exquisite delight, his happiness reaching its
culmination whenever one of them, more awkward
than the rest, was upset. No one was permitted to
drown, for either the Tsar himself or Boris or other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
competent persons were ever at hand to rescue the
shipwrecked; and many a poor dripping wretch was
brought ashore by the hunter, to eat his supper in
the miserable anticipation of more boating to be done
afterwards.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a new fortress began to take shape,
close to the old one, and the city of St. Petersburg
was commenced.</p>

<p>Boris returned to Moscow in the autumn, and
spent the winter with his family, to the great
content of his devoted Nancy. But his peaceful
home-life did not last very long; for with the return
of spring the troops were called out once more to
finish that which had been so well begun in the
previous year, and the hunter bade farewell to his
belongings, little thinking that he should come very
nigh, during this summer's campaign, to forming a
meal for the Swedish crows&mdash;nearer, indeed, than
ever before.</p>

<p>There were two fortresses which the Tsar felt
must be his before he could feel quite secure in
the possession of the Neva&mdash;namely, Dorpat, and his
old friend Narva, where the Russian arms had received
their first salutary check, and where Boris had
so nearly had his brains blown out as he swam for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
life in the blood-stained river whose surface hissed in
the hail of the Swedish bullets.</p>

<p>With the siege of Dorpat we are not concerned,
for Boris was not present. Suffice it to say that it
fell before the Russian assault during the summer
months, and that its fall greatly encouraged the
other half of the Russian army which sat before
the walls of Narva, among which latter was Boris.
Weeks passed, but Narva, mindful of former achievements,
still held out, and besiegers and besieged alike
grew very tired of the weary business of bombarding
one another, and longed for something more exciting.
Then the ingenious spirit of Menshikoff devised a
plan which promised at least the chance of a few
lively moments. Early in August the Russian troops
before the city divided themselves under cover of
night into two portions. One half retired out of
sight of the city, where they arrayed themselves in
Swedish uniforms, and returning when it became
light, with drums beating and flags flying, fell upon
the Russian lines, to the intense delight of the
beleaguered ones within the city, who imagined that
history was here repeating itself, and that Charles
himself had arrived once more in the nick of time to
relieve his faithful city, and to cut the Russians to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
pieces. Their delight was still greater when the
supposed Swedish hosts hotly pressed the Russians,
who slowly but surely gave way before them towards
the walls of the city. So well did the Russians
perform this wholesale piece of play-acting, that not
for one moment did the troops within the city doubt
the reality of the victory which their friends outside
appeared to be gaining over the besiegers. With the
intensest excitement they watched the progress of
the fight; and when there was no longer any doubt
as to which side was winning, they threw open the
gates of Narva and sallied out to assist in the rout
of the enemy. Then the fleeing hosts turned savagely
upon them, and what was a thousand times
worse, the late assailants of the latter, Swedes
though they appeared to be, now took sides with
their defeated foes and fell upon them also. The
brave Narva garrison fought well, though they were
surprised and demoralized by the deception of which
they were the victims. They fell back in good order
towards the town; and though they lost several
hundreds of their men, they succeeded in getting
home again and shutting their gates in the face of
the Russians, of whom they carried away one or two
prisoners.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris had acted as one of the pseudo-Swedes, and
had fought with his usual dash, both while the cartridges
had been blank ones and the swords ash
staves, and also afterwards when the curtain fell
upon the opening farce and the real play began.
He had pressed, at the head of his men, to the
very gates of Narva, and was fighting desperately to
effect an entrance, when something crashed upon him
from the walls above, the gates of the city turned
black in his eyes, and as he fell senseless at the
almost-entered haven, the last retiring squad of Swedish
soldiers picked him up and carried him into the
city, his men vainly struggling to effect a rescue, and
many of them falling as he had beneath the showers
of large stones and sand-bags hurled upon their heads
from above.</p>

<p>When Boris recovered his senses he found himself
in a small cell in the citadel, aching all over, and sick
and weary. He was still in the Swedish uniform
which he had donned for the purpose of carrying out
the ruse of Menshikoff. A tall Swedish guardsman
stood at the door. Boris was visited during the day
by many of the leaders of the garrison troops in
Narva, and was questioned by them at great length
as to matters upon which he had not the remotest intention<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
to enlighten them. One of the officials who
thus catechised the poor hunter recognized him as
having been the sham pilot in the Archangel affair of
a year or two ago&mdash;the Swede having been at that
time on board the frigate captured by means of the
hunter's successful deception. Boris was unwise
enough to laugh heartily as the official recalled this
circumstance, a proceeding which much incensed his
interviewer. It appeared that the commandant of
Narva and his officers were not in the best of humours,
by reason of the trick played upon them by
the Russians, and were inclined to make an example
of Boris, especially now that he was recognized
as having already outwitted them on a previous
occasion.</p>

<p>Every day Boris was examined by the authorities,
but all to no purpose. Gradually it dawned upon
the governor that there was nothing to be done with
this long-limbed Russian, whose legs stuck out of his
Swedish garments, and whose tongue could not be
induced to wag. He might just as well be hung on
the ramparts at once, as a warning to other Russian
deceivers who presumed to play-act in Swedish uniforms.
So Boris was given to understand that he
might prepare for his end, which would be brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
about on the gallows, and in the uniform which he
had dared to desecrate.</p>

<p>Even to Boris, who believed so implicitly in his
own star, this communication came with somewhat
of a shock. To be hung on the gallows like a common
spy, and in full view of his own people too&mdash;for the
execution was to take place upon the ramparts&mdash;this
was rather more than even Boris could contemplate
with serenity! One thing was certain&mdash;he must
escape, if he was shot a thousand times in the attempt;
anything would be preferable to hanging on
a gibbet.</p>

<p>But there was no question of escape at present.
The window, so called, was too small to admit of the
passage of a full-sized human being; and Boris was
certainly full-size. The door of the cell was but the
entrance to a stone corridor which, in its turn, was
jealously locked and guarded, and led into a courtyard
full of soldiers. Besides this, the poor hunter
was heavily chained. There could be no talk of
escape here. However, they could not rear a gallows
in this little room and hang him here; they must
take him outside to die&mdash;and then! Well, then,
Boris promised himself, he would have a merry five
seconds or five minutes with somebody's sword, or,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
failing that, with his own fists, which he had learned
to use with some skill while in England.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Russians outside the walls were
growing deadly tired of this long siege. A new general,
a foreigner named Ogilvie, had been brought
down by the Tsar to watch the siege. Ogilvie declared
that if the Russians peppered away at Narva
until doomsday, in the present disposition of their
guns, they would never take the city. The guns
must be placed differently. If this were done, and a
sharp fire kept up for two days, he would guarantee
that the place could be stormed with success on the
third day. Ogilvie's advice was taken. The guns
were brought round to the eastern side of the walls,
and a terrific bombardment was commenced and kept
up for two days.</p>

<p>On the morning of the third day, at sunrise, the
Tsar, with his new general and a group of officers,
was up and about preparing for the attack upon the
besieged city which was to take place that day. The
fire of the last two days had been marvellously successful,
and the Tsar was in the best of spirits as he
visited the guns which had been so well served on the
preceding day. Peter distributed rewards among the
gunners, and bade them recommence their practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
immediately. He swept the walls with his telescope,
considering which spot should be selected as the breach
to be stormed by his brave soldiers; for there were
several weak places, and it would be well to concentrate
his fire upon one or two.</p>

<p>"Ogilvie," said Peter, after a prolonged stare
through the glass, "what do you make of the erection
upon the eastern ramparts? What are they
doing? It looks to me more like a crane than anything
else&mdash;probably to raise stones for patching their
walls. They really might save themselves the trouble."</p>

<p>Ogilvie took the glass. "It's no crane," he said;
"it's a gallows. Some poor fellow going to be hung,
I suppose."</p>

<p>"Then why on the walls?" said the Tsar. "That
must be for our edification. They haven't another
Hummert, have they, or any deserter from us; or&mdash;"
Peter's countenance suddenly changed&mdash;"it can't surely
be for Boris Ivanitch! They would never dare!&mdash;Here,
men! a hundred roubles to the gunner who
brings down yonder gallows on the walls&mdash;fire, quick,
every one of you!"</p>

<p>Crash went the big guns one after the other, sending
the stonework flying around the spot indicated,
and scattering the crowds of people who could be distinguished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
surrounding the gibbet; and, finally, a shot
struck the gallows itself, either full or at a ricochet,
and the erection disappeared. Peter gave orders that
the fortunate gunner should receive his reward, and
hurried away to see after the immediate despatch of
the storming party.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Boris, on the evening preceding the
events just narrated, had been informed by a friendly
sentry that he was to be publicly executed on the
following morning. He did not sleep the worse
for this information. He had lived up till now with
his life in his hand, and had stood many a time face
to face with death, and yet survived it. If by the
mercy of God he should escape this time also, why,
so much the better; if it was decreed that he should
die, well, that was no reason why he should fret all
night and destroy his nerve, in case it were wanted
in the morning.</p>

<p>At sunrise Boris was led out upon the ramparts;
and certainly his heart sank when he caught sight
of the gallows upon which these Swedish fellows
meant to suspend his long body. He was still bound
at the wrists as he marched up to the place of execution;
but they would not surely hang him in thongs?
Boris vehemently protested as the final arrangements
were being made, imploring the officer of the guard
to loose his wrists; but in vain. When all was ready
he was seized by soldiers, and in another instant
would have been carried to the gibbet and set swinging
there, when, at this critical moment, big shot from
the Russian lines began to fly high and low and in
every direction, and soldiers and crowd were scattered
in an instant to all points of the compass.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 577px;">
<img src="images/i_350.jpg" width="577" height="900" alt="" />
<div class="caption">"Bringing up his clenched fists together against the<br />
fellow's chin."<br />

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris thought this a good opportunity to make
his first move for freedom. He raised his foot and
tripped up one of the men who held him by the arm,
the guards with Boris between them being in full run
at the moment. The man fell. Thus freed of one
hindrance to his movements, Boris quickly turned upon
his second custodian, and bringing up his clenched
fists together with tremendous force against the fellow's
chin sent him flying backwards.</p>

<p>The crowd were fortunately too busy rushing hither
and thither for shelter from the Russian cannon-balls
to take much notice of the prisoner and his doings,
and Boris was able to dodge round the corner of a
house and into a yard with a gate to it before his
bewildered guards had recovered their feet. Kicking
the gate shut behind him, Boris rushed down the yard
and into the back door of a house. Here he found<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
himself within a kitchen, in which a woman was busy
preparing food, presumably for some one's breakfast
Boris appealed to her to cut his thongs, which she (he
being still in his Swedish uniform) immediately did,
without asking questions. Having heartily thanked
the amiable cook, he went back to the yard and
prospected through the key-hole of the gate.</p>

<p>The Russian gunners had made good practice, he
observed, during the last few minutes. The crowd was
dispersed; the gallows had disappeared&mdash;shot away,
doubtless; many dead soldiers lay about the walls
and in the street below&mdash;there was one just outside
the yard gate.</p>

<p>This was the very opportunity the hunter required.
He opened the gate and dragged the man inside, where
he despoiled him of his sword. He recognized the
fellow as one of the guards from whose hands he had
escaped a few minutes since: clearly he had been in
the act of following Boris into the yard when he was
shot down.</p>

<p>Now Boris was ready for anything. If they came
to fetch him here, at this gateway&mdash;well, it was narrow,
and, barring accidents, he thought he could defend
it against swords all day!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he was not again molested,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
for the garrison had enough to do in defending the
breaches in their walls from the storming party to
have any time to search for the escaped prisoner.
When his fellow-officers and the men of his regiment
came scouring into the town an hour afterwards,
flushed with victory, and on plunder and prisoners
intent, some of them rushed into the house which
had been the hunter's shelter since the early morning,
and there they found our friend Boris seated in the
kitchen over an excellent breakfast, of which some of
them were invited to partake, and waited upon by his
benefactress, the Swedish cook.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.<br />

MAZEPPA.</h2>


<p>And now the Tsar of Russia, well satisfied with
the success of his arms, was for making peace
with the King of Sweden. He had made himself
master of Ingria and Livonia, but was ready, if
necessary, to restore the latter province if he might
be allowed to retain the Neva with its two forts of
Schlüsselburg and Slotburg.</p>

<p>But Charles XII. would not hear of peace. He
would have the Neva forts, he declared, if it should
cost him his last soldier to regain them. Then Peter
sent ambassadors to the court of St. James in London,
to petition for the mediation of Queen Anne.
But the ambassadors found the British statesmen,
as they declared, too diplomatic and tricky for them,
and could get no decided answer. Then the Duke
of Marlborough was approached, and handsome bids<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
were made for his good offices, if only he would
consent to be peacemaker. The Tsar offered to the
duke the title of Prince of Siberia, or of Kief or
Vladimir, a large sum of money in gold, and "the
finest ruby in Europe." Marlborough did not at once
refuse to act as mediator, but, though he seriously
considered the proposition, nothing came of Peter's
offer, and the matter dropped.</p>

<p>Then the Tsar regretfully realized that there was
to be no peace, but that he must make himself ready
for war.</p>

<p>The year 1705 began with a victory for Sweden
at Gemanerthof, near Mitau; but Peter, hastening up
to the front with fresh troops, stormed Mitau and
made the honours equal. Neither was there much
advantage to either side in 1706, though the Russians
were lucky in retiring from the fortress of Grodno,
hard pressed by the Swedes, without serious misfortune.
Charles himself had awaited the moment
when the Russian troops must retire in order to
follow them and cut them to pieces, which he probably
would have succeeded in doing, but he was
delayed for a week by the breaking up of the ice on
the River Niemen, and this delay saved the Russians
from destruction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span></p>

<p>The following year was without military movement
on either side, but was spent chiefly in diplomacy&mdash;Peter
striving for peace, Charles insisting upon war;
and when the year went out, it left the latter young
monarch occupied in making preparations for the
invasion of Russia, and the Tsar equally busy in
putting his forces into order for the defence of the
fatherland.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Boris, after his terrible experiences in
Narva, had been but little engaged in the few military
movements of the following year or two, and had
spent most of his time at home in Moscow, or rather
at Karapselka, with Nancy and the children. His
little wolf-maiden was now seven years old, and there
was very little of the wolf about her seemingly; for
she was as pretty a child as could be found in all
Russia. Nevertheless she was strangely and passionately
devoted to the woods, and was never so happy
as when allowed to accompany her father and mother
upon their drives into the forest. In the summer
time she would spend the entire day there, wandering
about among the pines, or lying couched in a heathery
bed at their roots. She was never in the least afraid
of wild animals, and loved nothing better than to
hear repeated the oft-told tale of her own sojourn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
among the wolves as a helpless baby. If the truth
had been known, she longed in her heart to see a
big wolf, and she would undoubtedly have offered
to play with it then and there had one appeared,
without an atom of fear.</p>

<p>Her little brother Boris, aged six, was a fitting
companion to this forest-loving maiden. The boy
was the bear-hunter in miniature, strong and hearty,
and a stranger to all cravenness.</p>

<p>Nancy and her husband were proud of their children,
and were right glad, moreover, to have spent
this quiet year with them at Karapselka; for the
little ones had not seen much of their father during
those troublous war-years. Next year there would be
more fighting&mdash;any one with his eye on the signs of
the times could see that; indeed, half Europe was
convinced that 1708 would close with the Swedish
king dictating terms of peace from the Kremlin.
Why this should have been the opinion of Europe it
is difficult to say, for the balance of success up to this
point had undoubtedly rested with the Russian arms;
but Charles was making great preparations, and was
very much in earnest, and his reputation as a successful
soldier was very great, and, since he would conduct
the new campaign in person, those who knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
best made no secret of their conviction that he would
carry all before him. As for Charles XII., he himself
was perfectly sure that there could be but one end to
the struggle. He gave out far and wide that Russia
was to be subdued, and that he intended to do it.
She was to be forced to disband her new regular
armies, and Peter was to be made to restore to the
country the Streltsi whom he had abolished, and the
old order of things generally. The Neva was to
remain, of course, a Swedish river; and as for Dorpat
and Narva, and the rest of the places which his fools
of generals had allowed Peter to become temporarily
possessed of&mdash;why, Charles would soon make him
disgorge them.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Boris was summoned to the Tsar, who
was busy at St. Petersburg building that city under
difficulties. Peter wished to send him, he said, on
a mission to the hetman of the Cossacks of the
Ukraine, to inquire what force the latter could put
into the field for the approaching campaign of defence.
The hetman bore a name familiar to my readers. He
was no other than that Mazeppa whom Voltaire and
Byron have made so familiar to readers of poetry as
the hero of one of the most romantic episodes ever
sung by bard or told as sober truth by historian.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>

<p>I regret to say that the real Mazeppa was very far
from being the romantic hero he is generally supposed
to have been. His ride, strapped to the back of a
wild horse and pursued by numbers of wolves, is little
better than a myth, though founded upon a slight
substratum of truth, as will presently be shown.</p>

<p>Born of Cossack parentage, young Mazeppa appears
to have served as page to King John Casimir of
Poland about the year 1660, twelve years before the
birth of Boris; but by reason of his quarrelsome disposition
he soon got himself into trouble at court, and
retired to his father's estate in Volhynia. Here again
Mazeppa fell into disgrace, this time with a neighbouring
Polish gentleman. This is where Mazeppa's
ride comes in. The Polish neighbour, infuriated at
the young Cossack, caused his attendants to strip
Mazeppa of his clothes, and to fasten him with thongs
to the back of his own horse. In this undignified
and uncomfortable position Mazeppa was conveyed to
his home, which lay but a mile away, the horse
galloping straight to its own stable with its naked
master tightly secured to it. After so disgraceful an
exposure, Mazeppa disappeared, and he is next heard
of as a man of light and leading among the Cossacks
of the Ukraine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span></p>

<p>The Ukraine<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> was a sort of no-man's-land, lying
between Pole, Russian, Turk, and Tartar. To this
happy retreat fled, in former years, every kind of freebooter,
robber, and bad character who had made his
own home, whether in Russia or Poland or elsewhere,
too hot to hold him. These were the first Cossacks
of the Ukraine. As time went on and the Cossacks
became numerous, large portions of the fertile soil of
the country were reclaimed, and a great proportion of
the inhabitants gradually settled down as peaceful
agriculturists, tilling their own land. Those Cossacks
nearest to Poland became independent vassals of the
kings of Poland, and were called "registered Cossacks,"
because their names were entered in a book as "subjects"
of the Polish monarch, though they insisted
throughout on their absolute independence, and their
hetman or chief considered himself the equal of the
king, and brooked no condescension or patronage from
him. Towards the middle of the seventeenth century,
however, the Cossacks threw off the Polish connection
and espoused the cause of Russia; the tribe having
decided by their votes whether they should enrol
themselves under the protectorate of Russia, Poland,
or Turkey. Thus the Ukraine became Russian territory,
and the Cossacks, though "preserving their
privileges," acknowledged the Tsar as their head.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span></p>
<p>This was the position of affairs when Mazeppa
appeared among the Cossacks of the Ukraine.</p>

<p>At this particular juncture there were two hetmans,
one being at the head of that larger half of the
population which had embraced the protectorate of
Russia; the other, chief of a portion of the Cossacks
who still coquetted with Pole and Turk and Russian,
faithful to none of the three, but always on the look-out
for betterment. Mazeppa became secretary to this
latter chief. In this capacity he was, a year or two
later, despatched to Constantinople with letters to the
Sultan containing proposals for the transfer of the allegiance
of his wavering master from Russian to Turk.</p>

<p>But Mazeppa never reached Constantinople. He
was arrested, papers and all, by agents of the Tsar,
and carried off to Moscow. Here, by his diplomatic
gifts, Mazeppa not only succeeded in exculpating himself,
but contrived so deeply to impress the reigning
Tsar, Alexey, Peter's father, with a belief in his merits,
that both Alexey and afterwards Peter himself remained
his truest friends and benefactors, in spite of
every attempt of his enemies&mdash;and there were many&mdash;to
dethrone the idol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span></p>

<p>Mazeppa now realized that the Russian was the
real "strong man," and that he had espoused the
wrong cause. His late employer was arrested and
exiled; but a place was found for Mazeppa with the
rival hetman, Russia's faithful vassal, Samoilovitch, in
whose service he so greatly strengthened his position
that in 1687, when Galitsin returned from an unsuccessful
campaign in the Crimea, and in order to
shield himself threw the blame upon Samoilovitch
and his Cossacks, who had been employed to assist
him, Mazeppa found means to overthrow his late
chief and to get himself elected in his place as
hetman of the Cossacks of the Ukraine.</p>

<p>One of Mazeppa's first acts was to hasten to Moscow
in order to assure the young Tsar Peter of his
loyalty, and, if possible, to make a personal friend of
the monarch. In this he proved so successful that,
once having accepted and pinned his faith to the
Cossack chief, Peter never could be persuaded to
doubt his honesty, in spite of every effort to convince
him of Mazeppa's perfidy. For many years
there was a constant stream of correspondence reaching
the Tsar from various sources, warning him of
the treacherous disposition of his trusted hetman.
All these letters Peter invariably forwarded to Mazeppa,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
with assurances to the effect that his faith in
the latter was quite unshaken. Frequently the Tsar
added that the Cossack might consider himself free to
deal with his traducers as he pleased. Mazeppa was
never backward in taking the hint, and many of his
enemies were thus removed out of his way, some with
great barbarity.</p>

<p>As for the rights and wrongs of these matters, it is
impossible to judge whether Mazeppa was or was not
so bad as he was painted. His name is execrated to
this day in the national songs and ballads of the
Ukraine, where his memory appears to be cordially
hated, while the names of his enemies are crowned
with all the tribute of honour and love that song can
offer. An intimate personal acquaintance of Mazeppa
has placed on record his conviction that the famous
hetman was always at heart a Pole and detested
Russia, and that all his life he was on the look-out
for a good opportunity of casting off his allegiance,
and transferring it to Pole or Turk or Swede, as soon
as any one of these should have proved himself the
stronger man. At the same time, in justice to Mazeppa,
it must be mentioned that he undoubtedly
received more than one invitation from the King of
Poland to break with the Tsar, and that he invariably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
forwarded such proposals to Moscow for Peter's perusal.
Probably Mazeppa was a time-server, and was
faithful to Russia only so long as Russia appeared to
be the rock upon which his house was built. As will
presently appear, he eventually, in his old age, made
the one great mistake of his life, when his political
sagacity, which had befriended him and guided him
aright for many a long year, at last failed him and
brought about the ruin which his treachery undoubtedly
deserved.</p>

<p>Mazeppa received Boris with every mark of honour
and respect as the Tsar's emissary. His court at
Batourin was that of a king, far more luxurious and
refined than that of Peter himself; and Boris was
surprised to see the gorgeousness and magnificence of
this man, whom he had been accustomed to think of
more as a wild Cossack chief than as a monarch surrounded
by every luxury and refinement of western
civilization.</p>

<p>Mazeppa spoke with tears in his eyes of his love
and devotion for Peter, and quite charmed the simple-minded
Boris by his eloquent declaration that he
would rather be the bear-hunter himself (of whom he
said he had heard), and be ever about the person of
that most marvellous man, his master, than hetman of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
the Cossacks of the Ukraine, honourable and dignified
though the position might be.</p>

<p>To Boris's questions as to the forces at his disposal
and their loyalty to the cause of Russia, Mazeppa
replied,&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dear man, I have fifty thousand lances; and I
would rather each one was buried in my own flesh
than turned against the throne of my brother Peter.
Why has he sent you? Does he not know that we
are brothers, and more than brothers, and that all that
I have is his?"</p>

<p>Boris was perfectly satisfied. He could not doubt
this man, whose voice shook with feeling as he spoke,
and whose eyes were filled with tears when he told
of his devotion to the great Tsar, their beloved
master.</p>

<p>Then Mazeppa entertained Boris with much talking,
of which he was a master, and with a review of those
fifty thousand lances of which he had made mention,
or as many of them as he could collect at Batourin.
Boris was delighted with their wonderful feats of
horsemanship. Whole squadrons would dash forward
at the charge, the wiry little ponies holding up their
heads till their ears touched the Cossacks' bending
figures; then, suddenly, every man would dip down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
sideways till his hand swept the ground, and again
with one accord the entire body would recover their
original position. Then a company would gallop
past, every man kneeling in his saddle; followed by
a second, of which each Cossack stood upright. Then
a body of men would dash by, spring from their
saddles while at the gallop, and spring back again.
Then the entire corps would burst into wild, stirring
song, and charge, singing, at an imaginary foe. It
was a fine sight, and gave Boris much sincere pleasure;
and he returned to give his report to the Tsar, convinced
that in Mazeppa and his lances Peter possessed
a friendly contingent which would prove of immense
service during the coming Swedish attack. How
Mazeppa acted, and what is the exact value to be
attached to moist-eyed protestations of love and faith
from a Cossack of the Ukraine, will be seen in the
following pages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.<br />

RUSSIA'S GREAT DAY.</h2>


<p>In the autumn of 1707, Charles XII. made the first
move in the great game which was to decide
for ever the supremacy of Sweden or of her great
rival of the north of Europe. Charles left his camp
near Altstadt with forty-five thousand men, marching
through Poland; twenty thousand were sent under
Lewenhaupt to Riga, and fifteen thousand to Finland;
in all, the Swedish king put in the field eighty thousand
of the finest troops in the world.</p>

<p>Passing the winter at Grodno, Charles appeared
early in the following summer at Borisof. Here he
found a Russian army ready to contest his passage
over the river Beresina; but he drove the Tsar's troops
before him, and defeated them again at Moghilef, and a
third time at Smolensk, which point he reached about
September 1708.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>

<p>He was now but ten days' march from Moscow, and
there is no doubt that, had he pushed straight on at
this time, he might have, as he had promised, dictated
terms of peace from the Kremlin. There is no doubt,
also, that the Tsar himself began at this period to
entertain grave fears for the final outcome of the
struggle, and made proposals of peace which would
practically have annulled his successes of the past few
years. Had Charles either accepted these terms or
marched direct to Moscow, the history of Russia from
that day to this would have been written very differently;
but, fortunately for the Tsar and for Russia,
he did neither the one nor the other, and the reason
for this was the conviction of a certain individual of
whom we have lately heard that the run of luck which
had attended the arms of Russia had received a check.</p>

<p>Mazeppa, watching events from his castle at Batourin,
observed with disquietude the rapid and victorious
advance of the dashing young soldier whom all Europe
at that time hailed as a second Alexander of Macedon.
He saw his lord the Tsar, in the person of his advanced
guards, driven from pillar to post, and flying before
the soldiers of Charles like sheep before the sheep-dog;
and the politic soul of Mazeppa quaked within him.
Still he waited on, unwilling to take decisive action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
until there remained no doubt whatever as to the
final issue of the struggle. When, however, the
Swedish hosts arrived at Smolensk, Mazeppa deemed
that the moment had come when it behoved him to
declare for the stronger, and he despatched letters
secretly to Charles at his camp in that city, offering
to place at the disposal of the Swedish monarch his
entire strength of fifty thousand lances.</p>

<p>On receiving this communication, Charles immediately
altered his plans. He quitted the highroad
to Moscow, and turned aside into the Ukraine in order
to effect a junction with the Cossacks of Mazeppa.</p>

<p>This movement proved a fatal mistake. The Tsar
had not been idle during the last few months, and
though his troops had met with no success in their
efforts to stop the onward march of Charles's hosts,
Peter, with his best officers and an army of about
one hundred thousand men, had still to be reckoned
with before his Majesty of Sweden could carry out his
threat of dictating peace from the palace in Moscow.</p>

<p>No sooner had Charles turned aside into the
Ukraine, thereby exposing his flank to the Russian
attack, than the Tsar saw his advantage, and hastened
towards the Borysthenes, or Dnieper, with all the speed
he could, at the head of a strong force of fifty thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
picked troops. His object was to cut off the
main Swedish body from communication with the
army of Lewenhaupt, which was hastening to join
Charles in the Ukraine, at a distance of twelve days'
march behind him. With this force was the whole
of Charles's supply of provisions, upon which the
Swedish host relied for its maintenance during the
approaching winter. Peter, with whom was of course
his faithful bear-hunter, in command of the Semenofski
regiment, fell upon Lewenhaupt near the banks
of the river Borysthenes. For three days a stubborn
fight dragged on, and the brave Swedes strove to
break through the opposing ranks of the equally
valiant Russians; and when, at length, they cut their
way through, and the general joined his master at the
river Desna, he found himself at the head of but four
thousand men&mdash;the rest of his army of twenty thousand
fine troops being either dead on the battle-field
or prisoners in the hands of the enemy, who had captured
also all the guns and ammunition, and, worst
of all, the invaluable convoy of supplies upon which
the troops of Charles had relied.</p>

<p>This was a great day for the Tsar, and he celebrated
his victory by a grand Te Deum in the cathedral at
Moscow, leaving Charles and his famishing troops to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
winter as best they could in the Ukraine, in company
with their perfidious ally Mazeppa, who, instead of
fifty thousand lances, had provided but six thousand in
all, the rest either preferring to remain loyal to Russia,
or else joining Charles, but afterwards deserting. The
Swedish army spent a wretched winter in the Ukraine,
and Charles lost half his men by hunger and cold.</p>

<p>Before departing for Moscow, the Tsar demolished
Mazeppa's castle at Batourin; and from that day to
this, or until recent years, the name of Mazeppa has
been solemnly cursed once a year in all the churches
of Russia.</p>

<p>Mazeppa was safe with Charles, however, having
discreetly fled before the Tsar appeared, carrying
with him two barrels of gold, in which form he had
consolidated the greater portion of his possessions.</p>

<p>The winter was spent by the Tsar, as well as by
Boris, in busily preparing for the crisis of Russia's fate&mdash;a
crisis which could not now be longer delayed, for
the enemy was at the gates, and with the spring would
commence to knock loudly for admittance. When
the troops were collected and drilled into shape, Boris
received a signal favour from the Tsar in the command
of a contingent of these forces, which he was instructed
to conduct southwards to Pultowa, a fortified city on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
the river Vorskla, which had the advantage of commanding
the main road to Moscow as well as that of
being close to the base of Charles's operations. Boris
had charge of large quantities of provisions and ammunition
for the use of the army during the coming season.</p>

<p>The trusty hunter safely reached his destination
and took over the command of the garrison at Pultowa.
And none too soon, as it turned out; for early in the
spring Charles set out upon his march for Moscow,
and as a first step towards attaining his end, invested
the fortress of Pultowa, of which he expected to make
short work. But Charles was not so intimately acquainted
with the character of Commandant Boris
as you, reader, and I; and all his efforts to bring
the brave bear-hunter and his men to submission
were unavailing. On the contrary, he found them
perfectly ready and willing to meet him, in so far as
fighting at close quarters was concerned, and many a
time did the Russian troops sally out from behind
their protecting walls and give battle to their assailants
in the open. On one of these occasions, Boris had the
honour of crossing swords a second time with his
Swedish Majesty. The two men met at the head of
their respective parties, Charles being, as usual, on
horseback, the hunter afoot. Charles recognized his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
former adversary immediately. "Ha!" he cried, "Mr.
Russian, we are old friends surely? There was a
matter we left unfinished; come, lay on now. I am
on horseback; you shall have the first blow!"</p>

<p>Boris did not wait for a second invitation, but
aimed one of his bravest slashes at the king's head,
which the king neatly turned aside, aiming a furious
blow at Boris in return, which went near to
lopping off one of the hunter's ears. Then the pair
had a cut-and-thrust match, each laying on at his
best, until something startled the horse of Charles
and it swerved aside, just as the sword of Boris
descended from a vicious sweep at Sweden's most
precious crest. Most unfortunately for Charles, the
sharp blade caught his foot in its descent and inflicted
a painful wound, while at the same moment the horse
bolted and the duel came to an indecisive termination.</p>

<p>On this occasion, as always, the sortie did no more
than vex the besiegers, and the enterprising party of
Russians were soon driven back. But Boris found
that his men liked these sorties, as a change from
the dulness of the siege, and he was not the man to
refuse them their pleasure from prudential motives.</p>

<p>But the crisis was now at hand. In June, the Tsar,
fearing for the safety of Pultowa, hastened to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
relief of the garrison with a force of nearly sixty
thousand men. He crossed the Vorskla and established
himself upon the same side of that river with
the besiegers, arranging his lines so that if the army
of Charles should attack him and be worsted in the
fight they must be driven back to the angle formed
by the junction of the Vorskla and the Borysthenes.
Here he strengthened his position with redoubts
mounted with heavy artillery, and awaited developments;
which he could afford to do, for his troops
were amply supplied with provisions and ammunition,
whereas what was left of Charles's force&mdash;about
twenty-five thousand men&mdash;were in a wretched condition
by reason of the hardships they had endured
for many months while roughing it in the Ukraine.</p>

<p>The proud Charles, hearing that Peter intended to
attack him, immediately decided to take the initiative
and be himself the assailant. Still suffering from his
wounded foot, he was carried to battle in a litter, and,
placing himself at the head of his troops, he advanced
to attack the Russian redoubts.</p>

<p>It was scarcely a fair fight, for Peter's force outnumbered
that of Charles by two to one, besides having
the fortress of Pultowa with its garrison at their back.
But so bravely did the Swedes fight that day, that at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
the first advance they reached and captured the first
Russian line of defence, and were actually raising cries
of victory when the Russians, encouraged by the Tsar
himself, who fought all day at the head of his men,
made a tremendous effort and put a new aspect upon
the affair. Forth from the walls of Pultowa poured
fresh masses of Russians, with Boris at their head;
the Swedes, at the point of victory, wavered, but
fought bravely on; the Russian guns redoubled their
efforts and poured a rain of cannon-balls among the
ranks of the assailants; Peter called upon his men to
make their effort, and like one man the Russian host,
singing their soldier songs as they went, advanced and
drove the Swedes before them. In vain the gallant
Charles was borne up and down the lines in his litter,
shouting, fighting, encouraging; in vain Mazeppa and
his Cossacks made charge upon charge&mdash;for, in spite
of all his faults, it must be admitted that the hetman
fought well this day and performed prodigies of valour.
The Russians would take no denial, but marched
steadily forward. And ever as they advanced they
drove the Swedes before them; and ever as the Swedish
hosts retired the star of Sweden fell lower and
lower in the heavens, until, on the evening of Pultowa,
it sank for ever in the waters of the Borysthenes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris, as well as his master, fought like a lion on
this Russia's greatest day. His great object during
the fight was to come to close quarters with the traitor
Mazeppa; but though he was able at one moment to
arrive within speaking distance, he could not approach
close enough to exchange blows.</p>

<p>"Ha, traitor and liar!" Boris had shouted, as
Mazeppa dashed past at the head of his Cossacks, "is
this your sworn love and devotion to the Tsar?
Come and answer for your lies!"</p>

<p>"My dear man," said the courtly hetman, "the
rats leave a falling house. Peter should have made a
better fight last year. As for meeting you now, I
should be delighted, but there is no time for pleasure
to-day, I am too busy. <i>Au revoir!</i>"</p>

<p>Mazeppa certainly was busy, and it was no fault of
his that his side failed to gain the day.</p>

<p>Soon the battle became a mere rout. The Swedes
were driven steadily onward towards the angle of the
two rivers; and here they were forced to surrender
to their pursuers, though a few hundred men, among
whom were Charles and Mazeppa, succeeded in crossing
the waters of the Borysthenes. About ten thousand
had fallen on the field or in the redoubts.</p>

<p>That night on the banks of the Borysthenes Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
pitched his tent in joy and gratitude such as no words
can describe. Weary as he was with the tremendous
exertion and excitement of the day, sleep would not
visit the aching eyes or soothe the restless brain of the
victorious Tsar, and he left his tent and strolled out
in the quiet moonlight in order to breathe the cool
air of night and enjoy the luxury of a little calm
reflection upon the events of the day.</p>

<p>The July moon lay upon the face of the river, so
lately crossed in hot haste by Charles and the traitor
Mazeppa. What were they doing at this moment,
thought Peter, and where were they, poor wretches?&mdash;hurrying
on, probably, in terror for their lives, somewhere
in the heart of yonder forest, their hopes turned
to despair, their lives spoiled, the greatness of Sweden
buried for ever in the reddened soil of Pultowa field;
while he stood here and contemplated the same events
from how widely different a standpoint! To them
Pultowa meant ruin, complete and irretrievable; to
him it told of a fatherland saved, of an empire whose
foundations this day had been secured for ever, of the
removal of an hereditary enemy whose existence as a
first-class power in the north of Europe must for ever
have hampered and prevented the expansion of Russia.
And then, what a battle it had been! how his men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
had fought, and how Charles's soldiers had fought
also, to do them justice!</p>

<p>As the conqueror thus mused and watched the
moon's broad highway over the water, a man came up
and disturbed the Tsar's reflections. It was Boris.
He, too, was unable to sleep after this exciting day,
and had wandered down to the river side to cool his
heated brow in the fresh night air. Peter grasped his
old friend's hand solemnly and without a word and
wrung it until the bones crunched together; then he
took the hunter's arm and walked up and down by
the river's bank in silence.</p>

<p>"Bear-eater," said the Tsar at length, "God has
been very good to us this day. The Neva is safe; we
shall have the Baltic for our own. You have served
me well, my Boris, both this day and for many a day&mdash;ask
what you will of me!"</p>

<p>But Boris laughed, and said that he had all he
desired and there was nothing to ask.</p>

<p>"That is well," said Peter; "the wisest man is he
who is the most contented."</p>

<p>After a while the Tsar spoke again. "My Bear-eater,"
he said, "I am so happy to-night that I even
feel glad poor Charles escaped; but not Mazeppa&mdash;not
Mazeppa! Ha! if I had come within reach of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
the traitor!" Peter burst out laughing. "Poor fellow,"
he said, "poor fellow! he thought Charles was
our master, my Boris&mdash;poor Charles the Twelfth&mdash;the
new Alexander&mdash;who is wandering among the wolves
and the pine trees, tired and cold and hungry, in
yonder forest&mdash;poor fellow!" Then after a pause,
"Can you sleep to-night, Boris?" he asked.</p>

<p>Boris could not sleep, he said; he was too much
affected by the excitement and wild joy of the battle.</p>

<p>"Neither can I," said Peter. "Sit you down here
and tell me a stirring wolf tale or two, or a bear
story&mdash;something which will take us both from the
events of the day. This will ease our brains, and we
shall sleep after it."</p>

<p>So the pair settled themselves upon the bank of
the Dnieper and watched the moonlight weld its
silver ladder over the broad stream, and Boris told
many tales of adventure&mdash;of Nancy's bear, and of
his little Katie carried off by the wolves, and many
others. And when he had done, and glanced at his
companion, lo! Peter&mdash;like that other monarch whom
Byron describes as listening on this very night to
Mazeppa's tale in the sanctuary of yonder dark forest&mdash;Peter,
tired out with the joys and exertions of this
great day, "had been an hour asleep."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXXI.<br />

PEACE AT LAST.</h2>


<p>The return to Moscow was a joyous procession.
Never had the Tsar been so merry, so indulgent
to all ranks, and so absolutely free of all traces
of his evil temper. Charles had escaped into Turkish
territory, indeed; but what cared Peter for that? he
was harmless enough now. As for Mazeppa, it was
a pity he had escaped; but perhaps the Sultan would
hang him, or if he failed to perform this service,
likely enough the wretched man would save others
the trouble by doing it himself! In any case he was
out of mischief's way.</p>

<p>Peter offered up thanks for Pultowa at every shrine
and church and monastery on the route to the capital.
Further, he gave way to no excessive service of Bacchus
during this time, but passed his evenings with
Boris and others of his intimates in song and laughter
and tale-telling, using the vodka in moderation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span></p>

<p>Boris became quite an expert spinner of yarns,
most of them about his adventures with bears, as
befitted his title of the bear-hunter; but the Tsar
himself occasionally treated his hearers to one of his
own reminiscences, many of which were of stirring
interest. He told, among others, of an adventure in
the forest, when, having lost his way, he overtook
a soldier, by whom he was not recognized. With
this man he had sought shelter in a lonely hut in
mid-forest, which had turned out to be the headquarters
of a gang of murderous thieves. Here, overcome
with weariness, he had fallen asleep in an outhouse,
where he had sought repose in company with
his new friend. The soldier, however, suspicious of
the good faith of his hosts, had preferred to remain
awake and watch. During the night, this brave fellow
had protected his sleeping companion from the attack
of five ruffians, who ascended the ladder one by one
and were in turn despatched by the soldier as soon
as their heads appeared within the garret window.
The Tsar added that the man's conduct when he
found out whom he had rescued from assassination
was more ridiculous than words can describe, as was
his delight when he received his promotion to the rank
of corporal, together with one thousand roubles in cash.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span></p>

<p>Right glorious was the entry into Moscow of the
victorious Pultowa heroes. The church and cathedral
bells clanged; flower-decked triumphal arches had
been reared in every street; gorgeously robed priests
and bishops met the troops and chanted litanies of
praise, and sprinkled the ranks with holy water;
while the wives and children of the returning soldiers
marched alongside, singing and laughing and dancing
for joy. Nancy was there with her little ones, and
Boris took both the tiny wolf-maiden and her brother
upon the saddle before him; for the hunter was now
a general of brigade and rode a fine black charger
whose long tail swept the ground. The children
chattered in English as they rode and told their father
all the news&mdash;that Katie had caught a young fox at
Karapselka, and mother had given little Boris a new
pony from England which had run away with him
into the forest and upset him into a morass, spraining
his ankle, but he was all right now; with other information
of a like nature.</p>

<p>Those were happy days, and there were happy
years to follow. There was war, indeed, for Charles
by dint of much perseverance persuaded the Turk to
enter the lists against Peter and fight his battles for
him; and adventurous war too, for the troops of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
Tsar suffered defeat on more than one occasion in the
disastrous campaign of the Pruth, where both the
Tsar and Boris himself were once well-nigh captured
by the Mussulman enemy, and Peter was obliged to
surrender the fortress of Azof, the capture of which
had been the first exploit of Russian arms under
his flag. But in spite of all this, and of the fact
that the Tsar was still unable, as the years went on,
to conclude a satisfactory peace with Sweden, there
was more peace than war during the five or six years
which followed Pultowa, and the building of St. Petersburg
was the work that occupied most of the sovereign's
attention. The greater portion of his time
was spent there, superintending the erection of fortress
and city, and there he collected a large fleet of both
British-made and home-built vessels of war.</p>

<p>Boris lived in the new city with Peter, his house
being one of the very first to be erected. Nancy
and her children joined him on the Neva banks, and
soon became as ardent sailors as the Tsar could desire
his subjects to be.</p>

<p>As for Boris himself, he had plenty of congenial
occupation in endeavouring to thin the numbers of the
wolves which infested the forests around, and even
swarmed into the streets of the half-built city. Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
as late as 1713, about ten years after the first pile of
the new capital had been driven, wolves still occasionally
entered the town and carried away children and
women during the severe weather, when starvation
made them bold; and many were the exciting chases
which Boris enjoyed after such depredators, and many
were the lives he saved of those who had been seized
and carried off by the midnight robbers.</p>

<p>Little Katie, now aged twelve years, and her brother,
had an exciting adventure at this time. They had
been for a sail in the boat which the Tsar had given
them; but the wind having failed them while still in
the gulf, they were somewhat late in returning, and
landed at the farther end of the city in order to avoid
the necessity of rowing home against the current.</p>

<p>It was dusk of a September evening, and the streets
through which they had to pass were unfinished and
unpopulated; the open country, with the forest but a
short distance away, stretching straight from the road
on their right, while the river flowed swiftly towards
the gulf on their left. Of a sudden they became
aware of two gray wolves standing in the midst of
the muddy road, blocking their passage. Neither
child was afraid of wolves or of any other wild animal
that breathes; but they were unarmed, save for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
knife which little Boris, like a true son of his father,
invariably carried at his side. The children stopped
to consult: should they move on, in the hope that
the brutes would give way and allow them to pass;
or would it be wiser to retire towards the boat and
row homewards, in spite of the current? The wolves,
however, decided the question for them by opening
their savage mouths, showing their business-like teeth,
and themselves advancing, in order to carry the war
into the enemy's country.</p>

<p>"Get behind me, Katie," said little Boris, "I've got
my long knife; I'll take care they shan't touch you!"</p>

<p>But this was not Katie's way. She remained at her
brother's side, catching up a thick piece of wood, one
of many with which the ground was covered preliminary
to road-making.</p>

<p>And now occurred a most unaccountable incident.
The foremost wolf made a rush at Katie, stopped,
sniffed at her dress, and slunk aside. The other brute
behaved very differently. It sprang towards young
Boris, who stood up to it and smote bravely at it with
his knife, inflicting more than one gash upon nose and
head and shoulder. Each time it was struck the wolf
whined but came on again, until at length, having had
enough of little Boris and his sharp knife, it too slunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
away and joined its companion, and the two trotted
off towards the forest.</p>

<p>Nancy declared, amid sobs and kisses, as the children
related their story, that Katie could never be hurt by
a wolf, for every wolf would know by some mysterious
instinct of the relationship which her darling little
wolf-maiden bore to his kind, and would not touch
her. But that rude man, her husband, laughed loud
and long at the very idea of such a thing, as I daresay
my reader will also; and yet I am half inclined to believe
in Nancy's pretty theory, for want of a better.</p>

<p>While at St. Petersburg, Boris took part, for the
first time in his life, in a naval engagement. His
rank in the navy was now lieutenant, and in this
capacity Boris sailed out with the Tsar one fine
morning in the flagship of "Rear-Admiral Peter
Alexeyevitch" as the Tsar loved to style himself, this
being his rank in the navy at that time. A Swedish
fleet had been reported in the gulf, and the Russian
vessels were now sallying forth to sight the enemy, and
if possible to offer them battle. The Tsar-admiral
not only came upon the enemy, but engaged and overthrew
him also, capturing the Swedish admiral in
person, together with a number of his ships. With
his prizes in tow, Peter sailed proudly up the Neva<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
and landed at the senate steps, where he was met and
requested to attend and present to the authorities a
report of his engagement with the enemy. After
hearing this report, the senate unanimously decided
that, in consideration of his services, Rear-Admiral
Peter Alexeyevitch be promoted then and there to the
rank of vice-admiral. Thereupon the Tsar immediately
hurried back to his ship and hoisted the flag
of a vice-admiral. Nothing in the world could have
made Peter happier than such recognition of his services
as a sailor apart from his position as Tsar.</p>

<p>Boris lived to take the chief part in many adventures
both by sea and land. He slew many bears and
wolves in all parts of the country, and went through
more terrible dangers and sufferings during an ill-omened
expedition despatched by his master against
Khiva and India, than any which I have narrated in
the foregoing pages; but the limits of this volume
forbid me to enter into any of these, much as I should
like to introduce my readers to the ambitions of Peter
in the Indies, and the misfortunes which overtook his
arms in those distant parts of the world. Perhaps, if
the fates will it, I may find occasion to treat of these
thrilling matters another day; but the moment has
now arrived when I must describe the closing scene in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
this present tale of the Tsar's triumphs and his faithful
hunter's adventures.</p>

<p>For many years Peter laboured his utmost to make
such terms of peace with Sweden as should secure to
him those solid advantages which his victories and his
perseverance warranted him in demanding. But ardently
as he laboured for peace, Sweden, beaten and
subdued though she was, still held out for war.</p>

<p>At last, when the eighteenth century was already
a score of years old, negotiations were entered into at
Nystad which promised to bring forward a satisfactory
result. In feverish anxiety the Tsar sailed daily
in his yacht about the placid waters of the Gulf of
Finland, on the look-out for that longed-for messenger-boat
which should bring him the news that peace was
signed. One afternoon, the Tsar, with Boris and one
or two others, cruised thus close to Cronstadt, when
a small vessel was observed sailing with all speed
towards St. Petersburg, now the capital city of Russia.
It was the messenger-boat, and on board was that
treaty of peace for which the Tsar had fought and
negotiated and waited for upwards of twenty years.
With this priceless document on board, Peter's little
yacht fled through the waters; and as it approached
the mouth of the Neva it fired first one gun and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
many, in token of the glorious news it brought. As
the yacht raced up the river, banging its guns and
flying every inch of bunting it carried, every gun in
the metropolis responded, and every house mounted
its flag and sent out its cheering contribution to the
thronged streets of the city; for all understood the
meaning of the Tsar's noisy little vessel flitting up
the Neva in this way. It meant that war was over,
and that Russia had leave to grow and prosper and
develop. Oxen were roasted whole in the large
square in front of the senate, and the Tsar himself
carved and dispensed the meat to all who came.</p>

<p>In the evening a display of fireworks was given,
and here again Peter, in his capacity of all things to
all men, personally superintended the fun and himself
fired off the rockets. The senators assembled and
proclaimed new titles for their adored sovereign, the
maker of Russia: he should be known henceforth as
"Emperor," in place of Tsar, and to all time he should
be called "The Great," and "Father of his People."
That evening there were banquets throughout the city,
and the joy of the populace was shown in every way
in which a happy people can demonstrate their delight;
for all were weary of war and bloodshed, and longed
for peace as ardently as their sovereign himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>

<p>Lastly, there was a grand procession to the cathedral
of St. Isaac&mdash;or rather, this came first though I
mention it last; a procession of a fervent, thankful
population. The crowds in the streets all joined in as
it approached them, and the Tsar walked with the
priests and sang and chanted with them as one of
themselves. When the procession reached the steps
of the cathedral, and the tall Tsar stood upon the
highest and faced the multitude, a great shout of joy
and praise rang out, such as had not been heard in
all Russia before that day; and when, the shouting
being ended, the Tsar raised his hand and would speak
to the multitude, all were silent to listen. Then Peter
the Great raised both arms high over his head,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Sursum corda! sursum corda!</i>" cried the Emperor.
"Lift up your hearts, O my people!"</p>

<p>And all the people with one voice made answer,&mdash;</p>

<p>"We lift them up unto the Lord!"</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">J. M. Barrie</span> says of "The Coral Island":&mdash;"For the authorship of that book
I would joyously swop all mine. If there is a parent who has not given it to his son (or
does not do so within eight days from now), he should at the least be turned out of his
club. Many men, no doubt, become parents in order to give 'The Coral Island' to their
sons. Jack, Ralph, and Peterkin, I salute you, and hope you are all a fond memory
recalls. Not since my schooldays have I met you, but I know what was in the pockets
of the three of you the day you landed on that island better than I know the contents
of my own to-day, and your wondrous cave is more to me than the Strand."</p>

<p><b>The Coral Island.</b> A Tale of
the Pacific.</p>

<p>"Any one who wants boys to believe
that there is a better writer of boys'

<p>"The death of Mr. R. M. Ballantyne is the close of a long and busy and distinguished
literary career. The news will have been received with regret by the many readers
whom Mr. Ballantyne's books have stirred and stimulated and charmed. They were
written avowedly for boys, but they have been caught up eagerly by readers of every
age, old and young alike, and when once taken in hand have seldom been laid down
again until the last page had been reached."&mdash;<i>The Times</i> (Obituary Notice, 1894).</p>
